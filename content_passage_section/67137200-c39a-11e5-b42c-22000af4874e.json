However, the future of voting is electronic. Voting machines are only a first step. The possibility of remote Internet voting will bring incredible benefits in terms of accessibility and voter turnout. These are not benefits we can afford to pass up. We need to find solutions to the security issues, because electronic voting is inevitable.<\/p><p><strong>Speaker B:<\/strong> Voting machines are a short-cut that we can\u2019t afford. The mechanization of voting makes us vulnerable to unprecedented security issues. If hackers can compromise our voting, we will lose democracy in this country. The risks of electronic voting are too great. We need to take steps to make electronic voting illegal in this country.<\/p>",
