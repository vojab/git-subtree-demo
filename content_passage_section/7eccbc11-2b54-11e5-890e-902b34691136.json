    "contents": "As one thing eats another, the layers of the food pyramid narrow. These layers, called trophic levels, represent available energy. Animals at each trophic level depend on animals living in the levels below them for food energy. The largest amount of available food energy is found on the first trophic level, the base of the pyramid. Less than 10% of the amount of food energy that is available in one level is available to the animals in the trophic level just above. That means each higher level can support fewer and fewer organisms. ",
