I had heard of him, and now here he was right in front of me. He came to the store in May. I remember it very well because it was my birthday that day. Washington was leading the army, but the army did not currently have a flag. The army was fighting for freedom, but at the time no one knew if we would win. The men showed Betsy Ross a drawing of the flag of the new country. It had stars and stripes. I said, \u201cSilver stars would be great.\u201d Betsy said, \u201cNo, it will be too difficult to make those. The flag should be red, white, and blue.\u201d So we set to work that day. We worked on the flag for a solid month.\r\n",
