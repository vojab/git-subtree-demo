    "contents": "When archaeologists first studied the city of Teotihuac\u00e1n, located near modern-day Mexico City, they excavated only the palaces and temples, areas used by the elite upper class. All these sites showed damage from a fire that occurred around the 7th or 8th century. Early archaeologists concluded that the whole city was ravaged and burned by invaders, possibly the Toltecs. However, this conclusion has since become controversial. A modern alternative theory holds that the burning was from an internal uprising of the lower class.",
