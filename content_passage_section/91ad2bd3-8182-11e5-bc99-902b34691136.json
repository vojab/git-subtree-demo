In the past, a gardener has ordered ladybugs from a garden supply store, but when he released them in his garden, they immediately flew off before they could adapt to his garden as their territory. The gardener has read that if he sprays a solution of sugar water on ladybugs\u2019 wings before he releases them, the sugar water will temporarily stop them from flying without harming them, and the ladybugs will stay in his garden.<\/p>",
