    "contents": "I commenced life with the most refined notions of a woman's sphere. My pride of womanhood lay within this nice sphere. [B]ut I could, even then, see over the barriers of that sphere, and see that, however easy it might be for me to keep within it, as a daughter, a great majority of women were outside its boundaries; driven thither by their own, or invited by the necessities and interests of those they loved. \r\n\r\n<p>I saw our farmers' wives, -- women esteemed for every womanly virtue, -- impelled by emergencies, helping their husbands in labors excluded from the modern woman's sphere. I was witness, on one occasion, to a wife's helping her husband -- who was ill and of feeble strength, and too poor to hire -- to pile the logs, preparatory to clearing the ground that was to grow their daily bread; and my sympathies, which recognized in her act the self-sacrificing love of woman, forbade that I should judge her out of her sphere.<\/p>",
