    "contents": "Famous New York Yankee Mickey Mantle almost lost his leg in high school, after an injury playing high school football in the mid-1940s. During a game, Mantle was kicked hard in the leg, and the injury led to an infection of the bone called osteomyelitis. The leg became swollen, and Mantle developed a temperature of 104\u00b0F. Mantle went to the hospital, and the doctors thought they might have to amputate his leg. Mantle\u2019s mother wasn\u2019t happy with the idea of amputation and took Mantle to another hospital, where he was treated with penicillin, the new wonder drug. Mantle was ill for several weeks and lost thirty pounds, but he recovered with the use of his leg and was able to go on to become a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
