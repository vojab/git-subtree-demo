    "contents": "Tardigrades are tiny, eight-legged animals that live in water. Even if they are denied food and water for a decade, tardigrades can rehydrate. Tardigrades can survive a broad range of extreme temperatures. They can live under pressure approximately six times greater than the deepest ocean trenches. These tiny creatures withstand hundreds of times the amount of ionizing radiation that would kill a person and can even live in the vaccuum of space. Tardigrades are strange and interesting animals, even though they are small. \r\n",
