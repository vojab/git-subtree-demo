    "contents": "Oscar Wilde once said, \u201cEducation is an admirable thing... but nothing worth knowing can ever be taught.\u201d He was totally right. There\u2019s more value in real-world experience than there is sitting in a classroom. I\u2019ve learned a lot from working in a restaurant. I plan to run my own restaurant one day. I learned math by figuring out checks and calculating tax. I learned communication skills by conversing with customers and co-workers. If I couldn\u2019t do that, I wouldn\u2019t get a bad grade; I\u2019d lose my job. And I\u2019ve had to persuade them to buy our specials or our higher-priced items. Plus I\u2019ve worked with people from all different backgrounds and with very different personalities. The restaurant business is the best education you can get. And it\u2019s even better than a free education, because you get paid! \r\n",
