    "contents": "<p><b>President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, First Fireside Chat<\/b><\/p><p>My friends, I want to talk for a few minutes with the people of the United States about banking\u2014to talk with the comparatively few who understand the mechanics of banking, but more particularly with the overwhelming majority of you who use banks for the making of deposits and the drawing of checks. I want to tell you what has been done in the last few days, and why it was done, and what the next steps are going to be. I recognize that the many proclamations from the state capitals and from Washington, the legislation, the Treasury regulations and so forth, couched for the most part in banking and legal terms, ought to be explained for the benefit of the average citizen. I owe this in particular because of the fortitude and the good temper with which everybody has accepted the inconvenience and the hardships of the banking holiday. And I know that when you understand what we in Washington have been about I shall continue to have your cooperation as fully as I have had your sympathy and your help during the past week.<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>First of all, let me state the simple fact that when you deposit money in a bank the bank does not put the money into a safe deposit vault. It invests your money in many different forms of credit\u2014in bonds, in commercial paper, in mortgages, and in many other kinds of loans. In other words, the bank puts your money to work to keep the wheels of industry and of agriculture turning round. A comparatively small part of the money that you put into the bank is kept in currency\u2014an amount which in normal times is wholly sufficient to cover the cash needs of the average citizen....<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>What, then, happened during the last few days of February and the first few days of March? Because of undermined confidence on the part of the public, there was a general rush by a large portion of our population to turn bank deposits into currency or gold\u2014a rush so great that the soundest banks couldn\u2019t get enough currency to meet the demand...<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>By the afternoon of March 3, a week ago last Friday, scarcely a bank in the country was open to do business. Proclamations closing them in whole or in part had been issued by the governors in almost all of the states.<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>It was then that I issued the proclamation providing for the national bank holiday, and this was the first step in the government\u2019s reconstruction of our financial and economic fabric.<\/p>\r\n                                             <President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, First Fireside Chat, available at: http:\/\/historymatters.gmu.edu\/d\/5199\/>",
