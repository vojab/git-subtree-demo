    "contents": "The conditions needed to produce lightning have been known for some time. However, exactly how lightning forms has never been verified so there is room for debate. Leading theories focus around separation of electric charge and generation of an electric field within a thunderstorm. Recent studies also indicate that ice, hail, and semi-frozen water drops known as \u2018graupel\u2019 are essential to lightning development. Storms that fail to produce large quantities of ice usually fail to produce lightning.\r\n",
