Zest Stop provides health and environment-conscious consumers healthy, organic, whole-food drinks. The chain has developed relationships with local organic farmers for much of its produce and supports agriculture that replenishes rather than depletes the earth. Zest Stop is committed to providing foods that contribute to balance in mind, body, and earth.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>Services<\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nZest Stop offers busy Bay Area consumers a nutritious and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fast foods and coffee shops. Our menu includes breakfast, lunch, and snack options that are quick and easy, healthy, great tasting, and ecologically sound. Our variety of smoothies, formulated for every taste and diet, can be readily eaten on the go. All of our packaging is recyclable or reusable. A comprehensive salad menu complements our smoothie offerings. The midrange prices, convenience, and health benefits of our cuisine is a formula for growth.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>Customers<\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nZest Stop services a wide Bay Area market of middle to upper class professionals and artists as well as students at Bay Area universities. Vegetarians, vegans, and those who focus their diets on raw foods are a specific segment of interest, estimated at 140,000 consumers within the target location of our initial proposed 10 stores. A broader group of health-conscious and environment-conscious consumers forms the second major market segment of approximately 720,000 customers within the same area.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>Management<\/b><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nZest Stop has created a strong and experienced management team. Patricia Mendia, our CEO, comes from a health sciences background and has had 16 years of health food retail management experience. Karl Booker, chief financial officer, is a CPA with extensive experience with fast food chains. Chef and raw food cuisine specialist Andre Cordova is the chief developmental chef. Andre has owned and operated his profitable Berkeley restaurant, RAW, for five years. His raw-food cookbook has generated extensive interest in the benefits of raw foods.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nZest Stop is focused on achieving financial success through intelligent financial control combined with a high-quality, high-demand service. Our first test restaurant has been operational for one fiscal year. Figures from that restaurant and from our financial analysis indicate that with a startup expenditure of $915,000 on nine additional restaurants to be built in the next year, Zest Stop can generate $1.3 million in sales by year one and $3.8 million in sales by year two. A percentage of profits will be reinvested in restaurant expansion to a target goal of 25 restaurants by year ten.<\/p>\r\n<p><i>A Sample Business Plan<\/i>.<\/p>",
