    "contents": "An oil tanker headed for California hit a reef off the coast of Alaska, leading to the most destructive oil spill in U.S. history.  As a direct result, 11,000,000 to 38,000,000 gallons of crude oil emptied into the sea, creating a contamination of the coastline causing the death of 2,800 sea otters. The cleanup and devastation were felt for many years afterwards. \r\n",
