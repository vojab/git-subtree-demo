    "contents": "<p>World leaders acknowledged the 60<sup>th<\/sup> anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz, where over a million people, most of them Jews, were killed by the German government during World War II, by speaking about the event. Below are excerpts from two speeches:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIsraeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said: \u201cThe Allies knew of the annihilation of the Jews. They knew and did nothing. \u2026 They simply did not want to deal with it. \u2026 The State of Israel has learned this lesson, and since its establishment it has done its utmost to defend itself and its citizens, and provide a safe haven for any Jew, wherever he may be. We know that we can trust no one but ourselves.\u201d<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nGerman Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der said: \u201cAfter Auschwitz, who could doubt that [evil] exists, and that it manifested itself in the hate-driven genocide carried out by the Nazi regime? However, noting this fact does not permit us to circumvent our responsibility by blaming everything on a demonic Hitler. \u2026 The Nazi ideology was something that people supported at the time and that they took part in putting into effect. \u2026 We will use the powers of government to protect it against the anti-Semitism of those who refuse to learn the lessons of the past.\u201d<\/p>",
