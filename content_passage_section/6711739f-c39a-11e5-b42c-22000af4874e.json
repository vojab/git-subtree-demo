    "contents": "There are two types of stresses associated with reef systems: natural and human-induced. The effects of these stresses can range from almost none to completely destructive. Reefs display a surprising adaptation to short-term natural catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, and usually recover to normal community structure. These natural events can even be considered beneficial for biological diversity. Severe storm events on land can topple large trees. This opens up the forest to recolonization, allowing new species to move into the location, and results in a greater diversity of plants. This same process occurs with storm impacts to reefs. The damaged area of the reef is often recolonized by a greater diversity of organisms than existed before the storm. In the long term this event benefits the ecological integrity of the reef.\r\n",
