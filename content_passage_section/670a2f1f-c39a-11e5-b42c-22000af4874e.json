    "contents": " Chicago specializes in deep-dish pizza, with a thick crust and tomato sauce often poured on top of the cheese. Over two inches thick, it\u2019s baked in a \u201cdeep dish\u201d skillet. New York pizza is traditionally thin-crust. You can watch the pizza-makers tossing the big circles of dough in the air and rolling them out until they\u2019re less than half-an-inch thick. They\u2019re put on a thin metal tray, covered with sauce, topped with cheese and slid into the oven. \r\n         ",
