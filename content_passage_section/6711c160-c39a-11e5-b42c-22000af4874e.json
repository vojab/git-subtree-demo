    "contents": "Oscar Wilde once said, \u201cEducation is an admirable thing... but nothing worth knowing can ever be  taught.\u201d There\u2019s more value in real-world experience than there is sitting in a classroom. (17) <u>Wilde was right.<\/u> I\u2019ve learned a lot from working in a restaurant. I plan to run my own restaurant one day. (18) <u>I learned math by figuring out checks and calculating tax. I learned communication skills by conversing with customers and co-workers.<\/u> If I couldn\u2019t do that, I wouldn\u2019t get a bad grade; I\u2019d lose my job. (19) <u>I\u2019ve had to persuade them to buy our specials or our higher-priced items.<\/u> Plus I\u2019ve worked with people from all different backgrounds and with very different personalities. (20) <u>Learning words from different languages, these people have taught me about their cultures.<\/u> The restaurant business is the best education you can get. (21) <u>In fact, it\u2019s even better than a free education, because you get paid!<\/u>",
