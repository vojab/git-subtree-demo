The solution to increased fire activity will depend on its causes. If land-use history is the main cause of increased fires, then revitalizing land and using land in new ways may hold the key to reducing wildfires. On the other hand, if climate change is the cause of increased fires, these efforts may not yield results, and the root cause of climate change will need to be addressed.",
