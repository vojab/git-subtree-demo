Generally speaking, people will invest in a social business for the same kind of personal satisfaction that they can get from philanthropy. The satisfaction may be even greater, since the company they have created will continue to work for the intended social benefit for more and more people without ever stopping. The many billions of dollars that people around the world donate to charitable causes every year demonstrate that they have a hunger to give money in a way that will benefit other human beings. But investing in a social business has several enormous differences from philanthropy.<\/p>\r\n<p>First, the business one creates with social business is self-sustaining. There is no need to pump in money every year. It is self-propelling, self-perpetuating, and self-expanding. Once it is set up, it continues to grow on its own. You get more social benefits for your money.<\/p>\r\n<p>Second, investors in a social business get their money back. They can reinvest in the same or a different social business. This way, the same money can bring more social benefits.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since it is a business, businesspeople will find this as an exciting opportunity not only to bring money to social business but to leverage their own business skills and creativity to solve social problems.<\/p>\r\n<p>Muhammad Yunus. <i>From Creating a World Without Poverty<\/i>. 2007.<\/p>",
