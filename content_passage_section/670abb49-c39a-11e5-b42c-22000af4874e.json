Because the anode and cathode become unbalanced (with more electrons at the anode than the cathode), extra electrons are pushed away from the anode. _____(3)_____ the electrolyte prevents electrons from moving through the battery. When no circuit is connected to the battery, the extra electrons have nowhere to go.",
