    "contents": "The ages of Earth rocks, Moon rocks, and meteorites are measured by the decay of long-lived radioactive isotopes of elements that occur naturally in rocks and minerals. The elements used to date rocks and minerals decay with half lives of 700 million to more than 100 billion years. Radioactive elements are unstable; they break down spontaneously into more stable atoms over time, a process known as radioactive decay. Radioactive decay occurs at a constant rate, specific to each radioactive isotope. Since the 1950s, geologists have used this decay radioactive elements as natural \"clocks\" for determining numerical ages of certain types of rocks.  This is called \u201cradiometric dating.\u201d",
