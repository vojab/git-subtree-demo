The homeless on our streets are people like you and me. I\u2019ve met some who lost their jobs during the recession. Without anyone to help bail them out, they ended up on the street trying to make ends meet. Others are veterans who have mental health problems. They ended up on the streets because of their service to our country.\r\n",
