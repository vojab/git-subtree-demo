The \u201cinner Solar System\u201d is the region of space that is smaller than the radius of Jupiter\u2019s orbit around the sun. It contains the asteroid belt as well as the terrestrial planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The \u201cgas giants\u201d are Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus.  Following the new definitions of \u201cplanet\u201d and \u201cdwarf planet,\u201d our solar system now has eight planets instead of the nine we used to have.",
