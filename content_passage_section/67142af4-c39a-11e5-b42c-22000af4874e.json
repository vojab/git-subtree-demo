During the intervening time the Japanese Government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nThe attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. Very many American lives have been lost. In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\r\nDecember 8, 1941",
