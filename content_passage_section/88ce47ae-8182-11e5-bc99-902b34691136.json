    "contents": "AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is a disease where the human immune system is damaged, leading to vulnerability to many other diseases. AIDS was first identified in the early 1980s, and initially, many possible explanations of the disease were advanced. Experimentation and observation led scientists to the HIV virus as the cause of AIDS. We now understand at a molecular level how HIV viruses interact with cells in the immune system, which has allowed scientists to develop antiretroviral drugs, the main treatment for HIV. However, there is still no clear explanation why a person who becomes infected with HIV, even if untreated, may remain free of AIDS for a long time, or may start showing symptoms of AIDS relatively rapidly.",
