    "contents": "<p><b>The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925<\/b><\/p><p>The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it\u2014indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.<\/p><p>The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise\u2014she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression\u2014then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.<\/p><p>\u201cI\u2019m p-paralyzed with happiness.\u201d She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I\u2019ve heard it said that Daisy\u2019s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)<\/p><p>At any rate, Miss Baker\u2019s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again\u2014the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.<\/p><p>I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered \u201cListen,\u201d a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.<\/p><p>&lt;From The Great Gatsby by F.
