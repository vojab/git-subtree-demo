The Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), an image of a small region of space created from Hubble Space Telescope data, shows this diversity. Hubble observed a tiny patch of sky (one-tenth the diameter of the moon) for one million seconds (11.6 days) and found approximately 10,000 galaxies, of all sizes, shapes, and colors. From the ground, we see very little in this spot, which is in the constellation Fornax.\r\n",
