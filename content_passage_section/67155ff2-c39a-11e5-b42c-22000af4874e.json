    "contents": "Who benefits from gambling? The government benefits from taxation (and from all income, in the case of lotteries). Large companies benefit from casinos. Who loses? The money casinos and lotteries rake in must come from somewhere. It doesn\u2019t come from the very rich. It comes from lower-class and middle-class people who dream of a large payoff. Lotteries are a tax on the poor, marketed by the government. The wealthy don\u2019t buy lottery tickets because they don\u2019t need them. Corporations that own casinos don\u2019t gamble, because the house always wins. Nearly every person who frequents a casino or buys a lottery ticket loses, and the winners are the government and corporations.",
