Until now, many large \r\nretailers, fast-food restaurants, and other low-wage employers have been able \r\nto require salaried workers to work 50 hours per week or more without paying \r\nthem overtime. Many of these salaried workers make just above minimum \r\nwage as it is. It is really just a simple trick for big companies to get free work \r\nfrom their employees. That just doesn\u2019t seem fair, does it? Some might argue \r\nthat companies might have to lay off workers or even pay them lower wages. \r\nBut these companies make billions of dollars a year in profit. Why shouldn\u2019t \r\nthey share more of it? I, for one, am glad the president stepped in and did \r\nsomething about it.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ophelia Payne\r\n<br>\r\nDentville<\/i>",
