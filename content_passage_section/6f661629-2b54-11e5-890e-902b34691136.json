    "contents": "So far scientists have not found a way to determine the exact age of the Earth directly from Earth rocks because Earth\u2019s oldest rocks have been recycled and destroyed by the process of plate tectonics. If there are any of Earth\u2019s primordial rocks left in their original state, they have not yet been found. Nevertheless, scientists have been able to determine the probable age of the Solar System and to calculate an age for the Earth by assuming that the Earth and the rest of the solid bodies in the Solar System formed at the same time and are, therefore, of the same age.",
