The bottles came. I poured a little in my glass, then a glass for Brett, then filled my glass. We touched glasses.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cBung-o!\u201d Brett said. I drank my glass and poured out another. Brett put her hand on my arm.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get drunk, Jake,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be all right.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting drunk,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m just drinking a little wine. I like to drink wine.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get drunk,\u201d she said. \u201cJake, don\u2019t get drunk.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cWant to go for a ride?\u201d I said. \u201cWant to ride through the town?\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Brett said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Madrid. I should see Madrid.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll finish this,\u201d I said.<\/p>\r\n<p>Down-stairs we came out through the first-floor dining-room to the street. A waiter went for a taxi. It was hot and bright. Up the street was a little square with trees and grass where there were taxis parked. A taxi came up the street, the waiter hanging out at the side. I tipped him and told the driver where to drive, and got in beside Brett. The driver started up the street. I settled back. Brett moved close to me. We sat close against each other. I put my arm around her and she rested against me comfortable. It was very hot and bright, and the houses looked sharply white. We turned out onto the Gran Via.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cOh, Jake,\u201d Brett said, \u201cwe could have had such a damned good time together.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>Ahead was a mounted policeman in khaki directing traffic. He raised his baton. The car slowed suddenly pressing Brett against me.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cIsn\u2019t it pretty to think so?\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>Ernest Hemmingway. <i>From The Sun Also Rises<\/i>. 1926.<\/p>",
