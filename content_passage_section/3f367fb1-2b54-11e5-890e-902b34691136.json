    "contents": "Living organisms also move water around. Water is either directly consumed as liquid or extracted from food and then carried within bodies. It leaves the organism as a gas during respiration, is excreted, or may evaporate from the skin as perspiration. Plants are the major biotic movers of water. Their roots collect water for distribution throughout the plant. Some of the water will be used in photosynthesis, but most travels to the leaves where it is easily evaporated. \r\n",
