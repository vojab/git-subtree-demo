    "contents": "The United States is the world\u2019s largest producer of GM foods. The food giant Monsanto, the corporation that own patents on many GM seeds, assures us and the government that GM foods are safe based on studies, many conducted by Monsanto itself. Because Monsanto has such a vested interest in seeing the GM food industry succeed, the Monsanto studies prove only that data can be manipulated, not that their products are safe. Consuming GM foods absent the data we need verifying their safety is like playing Russian roulette with our health. Until we get more unbiased studies and studies that reveal the potential long-term effects of using and consuming GM foods, we should stick with eating organic foods only.",
