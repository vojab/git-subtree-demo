It was narrow, but Abe said, \u201cLet's do it.\u201d He was like that; \r\nhe would take a chance if it was important to do something. He went first and\r\n reached the other side all right. I went about half way across, when I slipped. \r\nHe shouted, \u201cDon't look down nor up nor sideways, but look right at me and \r\nhold on tight!\u201d But I fell off into the creek and the water was about seven or \r\neight feet deep. I could not swim, and neither could Abe. I was splashing and \r\ncalling out. He got a stick and climbed out and held it out to me. I came up, \r\ngrabbing with both hands, and he put the stick into my hands. I clung to it, and \r\nhe pulled me out on the bank, almost dead. He got me by the arms and shook \r\nme well. Then he rolled me on the ground, and the water poured out of my \r\nmouth. I was all right very soon. \r\n",
