I have no preconceptions.<\/p>\r\n<p>Whatever I see, I swallow immediately.<\/p>\r\n<p>Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike<\/p>\r\n<p>I am not cruel, only truthful\u2014<\/p>\r\n<p>The eye of a little god, four-cornered.<\/p>\r\n<p>Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.<\/p>\r\n<p>It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long<\/p>\r\n<p>I think it is a part of my heart. But it flickers.<\/p>\r\n<p>Faces and darkness separate us over and over.<\/p>\r\n<br\/>\r\n<p>Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me.<\/p>\r\n<p>Searching my reaches for what she really is.<\/p>\r\n<p>Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.<\/p>\r\n<p>I see her back, and reflect it faithfully<\/p>\r\n<p>She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.<\/p>\r\n<p>I am important to her. She comes and goes.<\/p>\r\n<p>Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness.<\/p>\r\n<p>In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman<\/p>\r\n<p>Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.<\/p>\r\n<br\/>\r\n<p>Sylvia Plath. <i>\u201cMirror\u201d<\/i>. 1961.<\/p>",
