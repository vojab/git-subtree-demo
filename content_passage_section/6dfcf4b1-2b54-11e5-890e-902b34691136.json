    "contents": "Juan works for a company that makes furnaces. He is trying to increase the fuel efficiency of #2 fuel oil in his company\u2019s furnaces with a new type of cold-start system. He hypothesizes that his cold-start system will increase mean fuel efficiency by 4% to 6%. To test his system, he conducts an experiment to measure fuel efficiency. He takes multiple measurements on furnaces with and without the cold-start system. He measures the fuel usage and heat output to determine efficiency.",
