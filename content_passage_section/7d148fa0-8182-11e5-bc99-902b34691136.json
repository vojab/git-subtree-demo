The attack on the World Trade Center towers was a tragedy that suddenly took American lives and changed the American perspective. While Veteran\u2019s Day and the Fourth of July commemorate those who have died for our nation, never before have so many civilian lives, from every faction of American society, been suddenly lost on American soil. As a nation, we mourn the loss of American lives, and as a nation, we must acknowledge the threat of terrorism at home and around the world. The tragedy is one that should not be forgotten. To make sure that people remember the events of September 11, it should be declared a national holiday.<\/p>",
