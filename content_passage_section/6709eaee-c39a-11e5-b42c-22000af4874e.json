We cannot trust that government, left alone, will take action to ensure that everyone will be given the same rights and opportunities as others. If no one speaks up or takes any action, nothing will change. In the United States, every effort must be made by its citizens and government to ensure equal rights and opportunities for all. This includes equal access to services such as medical care and higher education.",
