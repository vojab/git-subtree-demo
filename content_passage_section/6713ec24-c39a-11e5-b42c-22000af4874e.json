It is a new world that calls for a new American foreign policy\u2014a policy based on constant decency in its values and on optimism in our historical vision. . . . Our policy must reflect our belief that the world can hope for more than simple survival and our belief that dignity and freedom are fundamental spiritual requirements. Our policy must shape an international system that will last longer than secret deals. We cannot make this kind of policy by manipulation. Our policy must be open; it must be candid; it must be one of constructive global involvement, resting on five cardinal principles.\r\n",
