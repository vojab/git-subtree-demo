    "contents": "Many critics (20) <u>question<\/u> the type of thinking the Internet promotes. They suggest that the Internet changes the way we read and therefore the way we think. These critics point out that information on the Internet is designed to be consumed in small, bite-sized chunks. It is often presented in short, pithy blocks of text peppered with hyperlinks and images. They argue that consuming information in short bursts and leaping from link to link builds habits that are reshaping our minds. (21) <u>These questions are neatly summarized by the title of an article published in <i>The Atlantic <\/i>: \u201cIs Google Making Us Stupid?\u201d<\/u> Critics suggest the effects of these habits through questions like: Does the Internet cause us to think less deeply and more shallowly? Are we so used to short, catchy articles and blogs that we can\u2019t focus on longer articles and complex ideas? Are we so used to jumping from one idea to the other, from one link to the next, that we merely skim the surface of ideas without pausing long enough for meaningful reflection or engagement?\r\n",
