Arizona rose out of the legal aid movement, which advocated providing legal assistance to impoverished suspected criminals. Ernesto Miranda was convicted of rape, kidnapping, and robbery, with no other evidence than a confession he gave during police interrogation. Lawyers argued that Miranda was not provided due process and protected against self-incrimination. In 1966, the Supreme Court decided the case, holding that criminal suspects must be informed of their right to consult with an attorney and of their right against self-incrimination prior to questioning by the police. These rights came to be known as \u201cMiranda rights.\u201d<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe majority of the Court based its decision on the Fifth Amendment\u2019s protection against self-incrimination and the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of an attorney. The Court decided that suspects must be informed of their constitutional rights to counteract pressure and persuasion. In the 5\u20134 majority decision, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote, \u201cThe warning of the right to remain silent must be accompanied by the explanation that anything said can and will be used against the individual in court. This warning is needed in order to make him aware not only of the privilege, but also of the consequences of forgoing it.\u2026 [T]his warning may serve to make the individual more acutely aware that he is faced with a phase of the adversary system\u2014that he is not in the presence of persons acting solely in his interests.\u2026\u201d<\/p>",
