    "contents": "The second law explains how the velocity of an object changes when it is subjected to an external force. The law defines a force to be equal to change in momentum (mass times velocity) per change in time. Newton also developed the calculus of mathematics, and the \u201cchanges\u201d expressed in the second law are most accurately defined in differential forms. (Calculus can also be used to determine the velocity and location variations experienced by an object subjected to an external force.) For an object with a constant mass <em>m<\/em>, the second law states that the force <em>F<\/em> is the product of an object\u2019s mass and its acceleration <em>a<\/em>:",
