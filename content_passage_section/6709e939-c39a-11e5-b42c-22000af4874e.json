More often than not, the environment into which a person is born dictates the rights and opportunities the person will have in his or her lifetime. People are not able to determine prior to birth the environment into which they are born. Therefore, their rights and opportunities are relative to their environment. This has been demonstrated in the form of slavery and different class structures throughout the ages. ",
