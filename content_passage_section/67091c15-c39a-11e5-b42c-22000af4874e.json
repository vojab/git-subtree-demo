    "contents": "I was sick\u2014sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my senses were leaving\r\nme. The sentence\u2014the dread sentence of death\u2014was the last of distinct accentuation which reached my ears. After that, the sound of the inquisito-\r\nrial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum. It conveyed\r\nto my soul the idea of revolution\u2014perhaps from its association in fancy\r\nwith the burr of a mill wheel. This only for a brief period; for presently I heard no more. Yet, for a while, I saw; but with how terrible an exaggeration! I saw the lips of the black-robed judges. They appeared to me white\u2014whiter than the sheet upon which I trace these words\u2014and thin even to grotesqueness; thin with the intensity of their expression of firmness\u2014of immovable resolution\u2014of stern contempt of human torture. I saw that the decrees of what to me was Fate, were still issuing from those lips. I saw them writhe with a deadly locution. I saw them fashion the syllables of my name; and I shuddered because no sound succeeded. I saw, too, for a few moments of delirious horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n",
