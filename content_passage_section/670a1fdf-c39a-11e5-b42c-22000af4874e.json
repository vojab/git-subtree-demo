    "contents": "(1) Everyone knows that oxidation is a chemical reaction that causes a substance to gain oxygen. (2) One awesome example of oxidation and reduction occurs during the extraction of iron from ore. (3) In this process, iron oxide reacts with carbon monoxide. (4) The iron oxide loses oxygen molecules, resulting in iron. (5) The carbon monoxide gains oxygen molecules, resulting in carbon dioxide. (6) The most common type of oxidation that people recognize is rust formation on iron exposed to water. (7) This oxidation is the result of an electrochemical process that ultimately leads to unprotected iron gaining oxygen molecules and becoming iron oxide, or rust. (8) When one Substance is oxidized, another Substance loses oxygen, a process called reduction. ",
