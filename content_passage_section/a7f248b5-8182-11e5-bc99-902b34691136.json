He started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the head of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his manner. Without a moment\u2019s hesitation he ran to her and said:<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cI acted mighty mean to-day, Becky, and I\u2019m so sorry. I won\u2019t ever, ever do that way again, as long as ever I live\u2014please make up, won\u2019t you?\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:<\/p>\r\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll thank you to keep yourself TO yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I\u2019ll never speak to you again.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not even presence of mind enough to say \u201cWho cares, Miss Smarty?\u201d until the right time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a fine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were a boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled one in return, and the angry breach was complete.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mark Twain. <i>From The Adventures of Tom Sawyer<\/i>. 1876.<\/p>",
