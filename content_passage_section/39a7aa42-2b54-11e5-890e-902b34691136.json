    "contents": "Once [Jim] stole the teacher\u2019s pen-knife, and, when he was afraid it would be found out and he would get whipped, he slipped it into George Wilson\u2019s cap\u2014poor Widow Wilson\u2019s son, the moral boy, the good little boy of the village, who always obeyed his mother, and never told an untruth, and was fond of his lessons, and infatuated with Sunday-school. And when the knife dropped from the cap, and poor George hung his head and blushed, as if in conscious guilt, and the grieved teacher charged the theft upon him, and was just in the very act of bringing the switch down upon his trembling shoulders, a white-haired improbable justice of the peace did not suddenly appear in their midst, and strike an attitude and say, \u201cSpare this noble boy\u2014there stands the cowering culprit! I was passing the school- door at recess, and unseen myself, I saw the theft committed!\u201d And then Jim didn\u2019t get whaled, and the venerable justice didn\u2019t read the tearful school a homily and take George by the hand and say such a boy deserved to be exalted, and then tell him to come and make his home with him, and sweep out the office, and make fires, and run errands, and chop wood, and study law, and help his wife to do household labors, and have all the balance of the time to play, and get forty cents a month, and be happy. No; it would have happened that way in the books, but it didn\u2019t happen that way to Jim. No meddling old clam of a justice dropped in to make trouble, and so the\r\nmodel boy George got thrashed, and Jim was glad of it because, you know, Jim hated moral boys. Jim said he was \u201cdown on them milk-sops.\u201d Such was the coarse language of this bad, neglected boy. \r\n\t\t \t \t \t\t\r\n",
