    "contents": "<p><strong>The Climate Change Controversy<\/strong><\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>Recently, a group of 50 scientists from around the world released a comprehensive new report on global change that concluded that chances are good that global warming is not the result of human-related greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>Strangely, this report, which cites thousands of peer-reviewed articles, has been ignored by the United Nations-sponsored panel on climate change. Also ignored were this group\u2019s findings that \u201cno empirical evidence exists to substantiate the claim that 2\u00b0C of warming presents a threat to planetary ecologies or environments.\u201d Finally, this report contends that no convincing case been made that \u201cwarming will be more economically costly than an equivalent cooling.\u201d<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>The group that produced the ignored report is the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC). In contrast to the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is government-sponsored, politically motivated, and inclined to believe that climate change is a problem that demands immediate U.N. action, the NIPCC has \u201cno formal attachment to or sponsorship from any government or governmental agency\u201d and is \u201cwholly independent of political pressures and influences.\u201d For this reason, NIPCC is unlikely to be predisposed to \u201cpresent politically motivated conclusions or policy recommendations.\u201d<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>The 1200-page report produced by NIPCC, Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science, found that even if the \u201cconcentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide were to double,\u201d the \u201cwarming that would occur would likely be modest and cause no net harm to the global environment or to human well-being.\u201d In short, the report rebuts the findings of the United Nations\u2019 IPCC, which the NIPCC authors claim are in \u201ccontradiction of the scientific method.\u201d NIPCC argues that the IPCC report assumes that its hypothesis that \u201cdangerous global warming is resulting, or will result, from human-related greenhouse gas emissions\u201d is correct, even though there is no evidence backing up that hypothesis. Instead of proving that hypothesis, what the IPCC report does is collect evidence and make plausible arguments in favor of a hypothesis it has already accepted without sufficient proof.<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>The NIPCC report refutes many of the key findings of the United Nations\u2019 report including that \u201ca doubling of atmospheric CO2 would cause warming between 3\u00b0C and 6\u00b0C\u201d and that \u201cCO2 caused an atmospheric warming of at least 0.3\u00b0 over the past 15 years.\u201d<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>It is the contention of the NIPCC authors that the United Nations panel made \u201cclimate change into a political issue long before the science was sufficiently advanced to inform policy makers.\u201d  The authors further argue that \u201cmost government signatories to the UN\u2019s Framework Convention on Climate Change have deferred to the monopoly advice of the IPCC in setting their national climate change policies.\u201d One result of governmental policies based on what NIPCC authors claim is deeply flawed science, \u201chas been the expenditure of hundreds of billions of dollars implementing energy policies that now appear to have been unnecessary, or at least ill-timed and ineffective.\u201d<\/p>",
