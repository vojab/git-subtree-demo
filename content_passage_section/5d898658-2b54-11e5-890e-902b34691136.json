Water waves are formed by vibrations in a liquid and sound waves are formed by vibrations in a gas (air). <strong>(5)<\/strong> These mechanical waves travel through a medium by causing the molecules to bump into each other, like falling dominoes transferring energy from one to the next. <strong>(6)<\/strong> Sound waves cannot travel in the vacuum of space because there is no medium to transmit these mechanical waves.",
