According to the method of Arab navigation, instead of going from port to port direct, we first tracked eastward along the Arabian shore three successive days, setting sail at sunrise, and anchoring regularly at sundown. By this time we were supposed to be on the Somali coast, and the Nahkoda (captain) thought it was time for crossing over the Gulf. \r\n",
