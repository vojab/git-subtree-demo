We were not there, but we heard about it later. The army had to fight more battles. Just saying they were independent did not make it true. The war went on for 7 more years. We worried. We made more flags. In all those battles, soldiers saw that flag. Still, it was difficult to win. When the war ended, the country started. I was proud when I saw the flag. I didn\u2019t just make a flag. I was part of making the United States.\r\n",
