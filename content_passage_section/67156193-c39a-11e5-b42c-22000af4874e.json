    "contents": "The consequences of legalized gambling aren\u2019t only economic. The American Psychiatric Association and the American Medical Association recognize compulsive gambling as a diagnosable mental disorder. The more gambling is legalized, the more people will succumb to this disorder. In Iowa, a 1995 study found that 5.4% of the state\u2019s adults were compulsive gamblers, while before legalized gambling only 1.7% of adults suffered from this addiction. Similarly in Louisiana, four years after casinos and slots were legalized, a study found that 7% of adults were addicted to gambling. In Minnesota, before 16 Indian casinos opened, there was only one Gamblers Anonymous group. Afterwards, the number increased to 49. These social consequences of gambling are not well addressed by gambling proponents. What are the real costs to communities of gambling addiction?",
