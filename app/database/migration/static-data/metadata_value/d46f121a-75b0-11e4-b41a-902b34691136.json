    "description": "Use rational approximations of irrational numbers to compare the size of irrational numbers, locate them approximately on a number line diagram, and estimate the value of expressions (e.g., \u03c0^2). For example, by truncating the decimal expansion of \u221a2, show that \u221a2 is between 1 and 2, then between 1.4 and 1.5, and explain how to continue on to get better approximations.",
