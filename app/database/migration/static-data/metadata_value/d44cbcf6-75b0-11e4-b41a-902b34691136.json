    "description": "Understand that the probability of a chance event is a number between 0 and 1 that expresses the likelihood of the event occurring. Larger numbers indicate greater likelihood. A probability near 0 indicates an unlikely event, a probability around 1\/2 indicates an event that is neither unlikely nor likely, and a probability near 1 indicates a likely event.",
