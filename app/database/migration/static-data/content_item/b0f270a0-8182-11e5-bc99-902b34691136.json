He denies that he is drinking to get drunk, but Brett doesn\u2019t believe him. She wants him to stop, so she tells him twice not to drink. Finally, Jake gives in to her by suggesting that they go out. Brett will not stop pleading with Jake or listen to his excuses. She is adamant that he must stop drinking.<\/p>\r\n<br\/>\r\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting drunk,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m just drinking a little wine.
