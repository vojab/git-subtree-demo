Although many people assume that the more choices they have the happier they will be, this is not always the case. Some researchers have found that the more choice people have, the less happy they are with the decisions they make. An abundance of options leads to second-guessing, as people wonder if they should have chosen differently, or if they could have done better. For instance, a person who selects one pair of jeans from an array of styles, colors, and brands may have found a great pair of jeans but be worried that he could have chosen an even better pair. Instead of increasing happiness, choice decreases it. The same phenomenon may hold true for choosing among cell phones, salad dressings, and even dating partners.<\/p>\r\n",
