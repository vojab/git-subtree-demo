    "feedback": "This question asks you to compare the rate of change for two temperature scales. While both scales start at a different number, when the temperature in Celsius doubles, the temperature in F increases by 4. This is easier to see looking at larger changes in temperature. When the Celsius scale goes from 0 to 20, the Fahrenheit scale goes from approximately 32 to approximately 64. The temperature measured in Fahrenheit increases approximately twice as fast as temperature measured in Celsius, even though it is the same temperature!",
