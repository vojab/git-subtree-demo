A subordinate clause has a subject and verb, but it is not the main clause of the sentence. It has a dependent clause word, which shows the relationship between the dependent clause and the main clause. In this case, \u201cbecause\u201d is the best dependent clause word, since it best describes the relationship. No comma is needed after the word \u201cbecause.\u201d\r\n",
