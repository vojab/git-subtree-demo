She burned each square by suspending the square from a metal clip and holding a match to one corner until it caught fire. She recorded the time it took each square to catch fire and the time it took each square to burn completely. What is the variable in this experiment?",

In this experiment, a test was performed three times. The test was the same each time: a 5-inch square of material was burned, and the student recorded the amount of time it took to burn. The only difference from one test to another was the type of material: one material was leather, one was cotton, and one was polyester. The type of material is the variable.",
