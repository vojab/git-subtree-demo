You\u2019ll also want to consider whether you\u2019d be able to erase and reuse the media... particularly for DVDs and CDs, some of them can be reused and some can\u2019t. The least important thing to consider on this list is the types of files that you\u2019re moving. For the most part, you can move any kind of file with any type of media.\r\n",
