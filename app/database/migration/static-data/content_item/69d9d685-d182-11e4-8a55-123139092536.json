    "prompt": "<p><center><b>Speed, Velocity, and Vectors<\/b><\/center><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">The velocity of a moving object is its rate of motion in a specific direction. For example, a jogger heading north has velocity, because her direction is given. Vectors have both direction and magnitude, so velocity can be represented by a vector. In the case of the jogger, the magnitude of her velocity vector would be her rate of motion (like 5 mph), and the direction of the vector would be north.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">Speed, on the other hand, has no direction, just magnitude. You would say a car\u2019s speed is 55 mph because the car\u2019s direction isn't given.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><b>In which of the following situations would speed be used to describe the rate of motion of the object?<\/b><\/p?",

So, we would represent the snails rate of motion with speed, not velocity (that is, the speed of the snail is 0.5 ft\/min). In the other answer choices, the direction of the moving object is given, or implied.",
