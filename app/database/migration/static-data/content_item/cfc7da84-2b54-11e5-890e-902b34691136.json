First: to encourage them [American Indians] to abandon hunting, to apply to the raising of stock, to agriculture and domestic manufacture\u2026.Secondly: to multiply trading houses among them, and place within their reach those things which will contribute more to their domestic comfort, than the possession of extensive, but uncultivated wilds.\u201d",

    "feedback": "Jefferson\u2019s letter clearly shows that he wanted American Indians to give up their traditional ways of life and begin farming and making goods at home (\u201cdomestic manufacture\u201d). Offering peace and friendship implied that he would leave the American Indians alone to continue to live how they had been for centuries. These two ideas led to almost constant conflict and many atrocities in the West that did not end until 1890 when the U.S. Army completed its mission to confine all Indians to reservations.",
