    "feedback": "Both Justice Harlan and Chief Justice Warren agree that there is pressure involved in police questioning. Chief Justice Warren advocates the Miranda rules in order to counteract the pressure of police questioning, while Justice Harlan is concerned because the rules counteract all pressure.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\n<strong>Both agree that police questioning involves pressure.<br \/>\r\nThe majority of the Court based its decision on the Fifth Amendment\u2019s protection against self-incrimination and the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of an attorney. The Court decided that suspects must be informed of their constitutional rights <strong>to counteract pressure and persuasion<\/strong>\u2026. In the minority opinion, opposing the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, Justice Harlan wrote that the Court was overstepping its duties by adding unnecessary protections. He wrote, \u201cThe new rules are not designed to guard against police brutality or other unmistakably banned forms of coercion. Those who use third-degree tactics and deny them in court are equally able and destined to lie as skillfully about warnings and waivers. Rather, <strong>the thrust of the new rules is to negate all pressures<\/strong>, to reinforce the nervous or ignorant suspect, and ultimately to discourage any confession at all.\u201d<\/strong>",
