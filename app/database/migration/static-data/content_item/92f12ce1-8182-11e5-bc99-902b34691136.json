    "description": "Click the <u>one best answer<\/u> to each question.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\nHigh-pitched and low-pitched sounds have different frequencies, or wavelengths. The lower the frequency, the lower the pitch of the sound is. Different animals can hear different frequencies of sound, as shown on the chart.",

    "feedback": "The question really asks which animals can hear some sounds that are outside of human hearing. If the animal can hear sounds that humans cannot hear, a \u201cdog whistle\u201d can be made for that type of animal. Looking at the chart, most of the animals can hear sounds above or below human hearing. The only animal that cannot hear sounds outside of human hearing is the frog. A \u201cdog whistle\u201d could be made for dogs, mice, cats, and elephants.<img src='http:\/\/app.essentialed.com\/uploads\/assessments\/3378\/hnohibgi3392.png' alt='Answer Explanation Image'>",
