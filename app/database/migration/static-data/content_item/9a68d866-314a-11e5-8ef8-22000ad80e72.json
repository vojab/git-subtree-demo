    "description": "A researcher recruits 20 volunteers to test the effects of a vitamin supplement on metabolism. The researcher gives half of the volunteers a placebo and half of the volunteers the vitamin supplement. He then tracks their caloric intake, exercise, and weight. Based on this information, the researcher calculates the rate the test subjects burned calories, adjusted for exercise. The researcher found that those on the vitamin supplement burned calories faster.",

Natural variation in metabolism, or other factors that affect metabolism, might affect the accuracy of the experiment. Increasing the number of test subjects would provide more reliable data.<\/p>",
