Producers of these shows manipulate the participants by creating dramatic conflicts and manipulate audiences by claiming that what is shown is \u201creal life.\u201d Even when participants are behaving without directions, it is still inaccurate to characterize their behavior as \u201creal\u201d or \u201cauthentic.\u201d The simple presence of cameras and the knowledge that their performance will be watched by millions of viewers causes people to act quite differently than they would if the cameras were off. <\/p>\r\n",
