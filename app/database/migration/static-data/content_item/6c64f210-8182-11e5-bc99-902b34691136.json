    "feedback": "According to the passage, a bullion economy values the weight and purity of metals. Vikings cut up metal objects and carried scales to find the correct weight of metal for trade. In other words, Vikings went to a lot of trouble to trade using metal. By guaranteeing the weight and purity of their silver ingots, the Cappadocian rulers would have made trading using silver easier.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\nFew native Scandinavians had an understanding of coins when the Viking Age began around 793 A.D. Only the weight of the silver or gold in a coin had value, and precious metal was used as tender in many forms. In other words, the Scandinavians had a <strong>bullion economy, which values the weight and the purity of metals<\/strong>, not the form of a coin. Scandinavians of the time often <strong>cut up larger metal objects into small chunks<\/strong> known as \u201chack-silver\u201d to make up the exact weight of silver for a monetary exchange. Traders<strong>carried small but accurate scales<\/strong> to measure metal and provide an exact system of exchange even without formal coinage.",
