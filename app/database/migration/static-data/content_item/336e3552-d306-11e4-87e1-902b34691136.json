The farther east the mean center of population is, the higher the population in the East is compared to the population in the West. If the mean center of the population in 2050 were in Kentucky, the population would still be, generally, moving south, but there would be a higher concentration of population in the East than in 2000. This could be explained if the population in the East increased faster than the population in the West.",
