    "feedback": "The correct answer is to determine variables that affect temperature changes. The scientists measured temperature, altitude, longitude, and latitude. With this information, they can tell the temperature at specific distances from the volcano\u2019s center and at specific altitude. This will give them information to find patterns, and they could determine variables that affect temperature changes. Measuring at different locations and altitude won\u2019t tell the scientists whether the measuring equipment is accurate, although taking multiple measurements in one place might. These measurements also don\u2019t appear to show variations over time, since they are in different places and the time is not recorded. Similarly, there is not a group of temperatures that can be distinguished as a control group because no experimental variable is defined.",
