It makes sense that, during the hike after they start taking pictures, the couple take a picture of macaws.  The other choices don\u2019t fit at this point in the story. The couple is not just waking up, and they\u2019ve already started the hike, so they\u2019re not driving up the mountain. They haven\u2019t had lunch yet, so it doesn\u2019t make sense to mention dinner at this point.",
