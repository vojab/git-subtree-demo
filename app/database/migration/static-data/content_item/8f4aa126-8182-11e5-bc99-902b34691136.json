An apparently healthy married couple wants to know if they are at risk of having a child with cystic fibrosis. Which of the following inquiries would conclusively determine whether they are at risk?",

    "feedback": "An apparently healthy person may be a carrier of the cystic fibrosis gene. In other words, that person will have one normal gene and one defective gene. A child can only get cystic fibrosis if both of his or her parents have the cystic fibrosis gene, since a child gets one gene from his or her father and one from his or her mother. Testing both parents for the cystic fibrosis gene will reveal whether either or both parents are carriers. The couple is at risk of having a child with cystic fibrosis only if both parents are carriers.<img src='\/uploads\/assessments\/3378\/ixitgfo83385.png' alt='Answer Explanation Image'>",
