The goal is to give you practice on the types of questions you will see on the actual test and to give you a study plan for what you need to brush up on for the test.<\/p>\r\n<p>Take your time with this test. If you don't know how to answer a question, leave it blank and go on to the next question. Guessing is a good idea on the actual test, but for this test, we really want to understand what you know. If you are unsure of an answer and want to think about it, you can click \u201cReview Question Later\u201d to come back to the question later.<\/p>\r\n<p>Relax and do your best!<\/p>",
