In this case, the sentence means that men must wear every suit and tie\u2014all of them. The writer means that every man is required to wear suits and ties, so the modifier \u201call\u201d needs to be move before the noun \u201cman.\u201d\r\n<br\/>\r\n<u><b>All men<\/b> are required to wear suits and ties<\/u>, and women should appear in business suits, either pants or skirts.",
