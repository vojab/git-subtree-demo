The researcher gives half of the volunteers a placebo and half of the volunteers the vitamin supplement. He then tracks their caloric intake, exercise, and weight. Based on this information, the researcher calculates the rate the test subjects burned calories, adjusted for exercise. The researcher found that those on the vitamin supplement burned calories faster.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is a possible improvement to this experiment to reduce the possibility of error?<\/p>\r\n",
