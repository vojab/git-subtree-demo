The second type, laser epithelial keratomilieusis, or LASEK, involves the creation of a small flap in the outer layer of the cornea through which a laser then reshapes the inner layer of the cornea. In both procedures, the reshaped cornea is able to more sharply focus light on the retina, creating sharper vision without the need for corrective lenses.<\/p> \r\n",
