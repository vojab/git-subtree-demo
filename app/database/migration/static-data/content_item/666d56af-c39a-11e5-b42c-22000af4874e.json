New stores want more people to know about them! A new coffee mug also doesn\u2019t give personal information. A video of a party in a public park is also not very private. The only personal information in the video would be images of people. The best choice is your address. You probably don\u2019t want to give out your address to strangers if you\u2019re concerned about privacy.",
