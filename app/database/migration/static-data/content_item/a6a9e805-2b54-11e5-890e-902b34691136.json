    "description": "The following excerpt is from the Supreme Court decision <i>Tinker v. Des Moines<\/i>, 1969. In the case, 5 students were suspended from school for wearing black armbands in protest of the Vietnam War. The opinion of the court was written by Justice Abe Fortas.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n\u201cIt can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate. This has been the unmistakable holding of this Court for almost 50 years.\u201d\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n\u201c...the record does not demonstrate any facts which might reasonably have led school authorities to forecast substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities, and no disturbances or disorders on the school premises in fact occurred. These petitioners merely went about their ordained rounds in school. Their deviation consisted only in wearing on their sleeve a band of black cloth, not more than two inches wide. They wore it to exhibit their disapproval of the Vietnam hostilities and their advocacy of a truce, to make their views known, and, by their example, to influence others to adopt them. They neither interrupted school activities nor sought to intrude in the school affairs or the lives of others. They caused discussion outside of the classrooms, but no interference with work and no disorder. In the circumstances, our Constitution does not permit officials of the State to deny their form of expression.\u201d",

Des Moines<\/i> upheld the principle of \u201csymbolic speech\u201d meaning that a demonstration like wearing an armband - as long as it did not lead to significant disruption - is a freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment. Symbolic speech has been further defined as \u201cfreedom of expression\u201d and cannot be limited by schools unless it leads to a disruption that would affect student learning.\r\n",
