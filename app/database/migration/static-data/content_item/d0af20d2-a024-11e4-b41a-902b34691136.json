    "description": "A piece of glass that bends parallel rays of light so that they cross and form an image is a lens. The eye has a lens (made of organic tissue, not glass) that forms images on the retina, located at the back of the eyeball. For a person with normal vision, the focal length of the eyeball is the diameter of the eye, as in the diagram. For a nearsighted person, the eyeball's focal length is too short, focusing objects in front of the retina, rather than on it. The nearsighted person can clearly see objects close up, but not far away.",
