    "feedback": "<p>One sentence that is punctuated correctly is: \u201cWe can help you compare the available educational tools and find the product that best suits your needs.\u201d The second part of the sentence (\u201cfind the product that best suits your needs\u201d) is part of a compound predicate. The verb in this sentence is \u201ccompare and find.\u201d There should not be any punctuation before the \u201cand\u201d in a compound predicate with two verbs like this one.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other correctly punctuated sentence is: \u201cThey can greatly enhance the educational experience, but implementing this new technology can be challenging.\u201d The conjunction \u201cbut\u201d joins two complete independent clauses, so a comma is correct.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sentence \u201cSeveral large companies provide interactive whiteboards and most of these products use proprietary software\u201d needs a comma before the \u201cand,\u201d since it joins two complete independent clauses.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sentence \u201cWe would be happy to provide an estimate, for interactive whiteboards\u201d has an unnecessary comma. No comma is needed before a prepositional phrase at the end of a sentence.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sentence \u201cCan you attend a meeting at our store on Monday June 3?\u201d needs a comma between the day of the week and the date.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sentence \u201cInteractive whiteboards are very popular; but often schools don\u2019t know how to integrate the technology into learning\u201d should have a comma instead of a semicolon.<\/p>",
