    "feedback": "The sentence is two independent clauses joined by a comma and the conjunction \u201cbut.\u201d \u201cRecyling has increased from less than 10% of household waste in 1980 to over 30%\u201d is an independent clause because it could be a sentence by itself. \u201cAmerica still has a problem with waste\u201d is also an independent clause. One way to change this sentence is by making one of the independent clauses into a subordinate, or dependant, clause by adding a subordinating conjunction, such as \u201cAlthough,\u201d and deleting the conjunction. The revised sentence reads: \u201cAlthough recycling has increased from less than 10% of household waste in 1980 to over 30%, America still has a problem with waste.\u201d",
