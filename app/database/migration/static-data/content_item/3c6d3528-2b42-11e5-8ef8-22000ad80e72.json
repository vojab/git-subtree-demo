The correct spelling is \u201cyour.\u201d You also need to choose the correct spelling of the commonly confused words \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cpersonnel.\u201d The word \u201cpersonnel\u201d is incorrect; it means employees or workers. The word \u201cpersonal\u201d is correct. It means belonging to a particular person.",
