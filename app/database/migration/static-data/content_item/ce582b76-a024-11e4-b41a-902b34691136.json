    "prompt": "<p>The slope of the line for liquid D is two times greater than liquid B. The scientists want to verify their results for liquid B. However, the supply of liquid B is running low and they only have 100 g left, which is half as much as they used in the first trial, 200 g. What will the temperature of the sample of liquid D be after 4 minutes? (If the methods and measurements were correct in the first experiment.)<\/p>\r\n<p>Click on the graph to place a dot indicating the temperature of liquid D after 4 minutes.  To remove a dot, click on it again.<\/p>",
    "description": "<p>Specific heat capacity is a measure of how much thermal energy, or heat, a material can hold. It is measured by the amount of thermal energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram (1 g) of a substance by one degree Celsius (1 C). It takes more heat to increase the temperature of a substance with a high specific heat capacity than a substance with a low specific heat capacity. The graph below shows the temperature change of equal amounts of five different liquids heated with the same method for four minutes.<\/p>",

    "feedback": "If the mass of liquid B is cut in half, then it will take half the amount of energy to increase the temperature by one degree. Liquid B has twice the specific heat capacity of liquid D. This means to increase the temperature by one degree of equal amounts of liquid B and liquid D, it takes half the energy to heat liquid D than liquid B. Therefore, the second trial with only 100 g of liquid B will have the same temperature as 200 g of liquid D.\r\n<br \/><br \/>\r\n<img src=\"\/content-assets\/science-test-2\/367-correct-1702.png\" alt=\"Graph\" \/>",
