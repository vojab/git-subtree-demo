Don't fight the rip current.<\/li>\r\n<li>To get out of the rip current, swim sideways, parallel to the beach. This will get you out of the rip current so you can swim back in with the waves helping you along.<\/li>\r\n<li>When out of the rip current, swim at an angle away from the rip current and toward shore.<\/li>\r\n<li>If you can't escape this way, try to float or calmly tread water. Rip current strength eventually weakens offshore. When it does, swim away from the rip current toward shore.<\/li>\r\n<li>If at any time you are unable to reach the shore, draw attention to yourself: face the shore, wave your arms, and yell for help.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The best answer, therefore, is:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of fighting the current, swim parallel to the beach until you are free of the current, then swim to shore at an angle\u2014away from the rip current\u2014with the incoming waves.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-size:small\">Source: http:\/\/www.noaa.gov\/features\/monitoring_0609\/ripcurrent.html<\/p>",
