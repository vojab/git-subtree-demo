    "feedback": "According to the passage, Europe was overpopulated before the Black Plague. The bubonic plague did not cause overpopulation. In fact, it reduced by population by 30% to 50%.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\nThe bubonic plague epidemic of the mid-14th century, often called the Black Death or the Black Plague, caused a large loss of life in Europe. <strong>Europe was overpopulated before the plague,<\/strong> but disease killed 30% to 50% of the population. The decrease in population brought about economic changes, as well. In Western Europe, peasants gained more power. The lack of peasants who could perform cheap labor caused landlords to offer more freedom and higher wages to attract workers. Some argue that this innovation represents the roots of capitalism, and the resulting dramatic changes in society led to the Renaissance.",
