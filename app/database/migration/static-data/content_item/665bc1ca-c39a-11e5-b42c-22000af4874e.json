    "feedback": "The correct answer is \"When a circuit is connected to the anode and cathode, the electrons move through the circuit.\" The clause \u201cwhen a circuit is connected to the anode and cathode\u201d is a dependent clause. A subordinating conjunction such as \u201cwhen\u201d or \u201cbecause\u201d shows that the clause can\u2019t stand alone as a sentence. There should be a comma after \u201ccathode\u201d to separate the dependent clause from the independent clause. Using a period or a semicolon after an independent clause is incorrect; the dependent clause becomes a fragment. The sentence \u201cOnce electricity is flowing, in the circuit it can be used, to power an electric device\u201d has two unnecessary commas. There should be one comma at the end of the dependent clause, after the word \u201ccircuit.\u201d\r\n",
