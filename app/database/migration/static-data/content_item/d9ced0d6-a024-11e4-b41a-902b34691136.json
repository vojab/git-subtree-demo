    "prompt": "The graph below shows the velocity of the roller coaster car as it moves from point A to point B. How will the velocity of the car change as it moves from point B to point C? Place a dot on the graph by clicking on the graph showing the velocity of the car when it reaches point C and the time (in seconds) at which it reaches point C. (Note: assume that there are no friction or drag forces.) <br>",
    "description": "There are many forms of energy. Two common forms of energy are Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy. Kinetic Energy can be thought of as energy of motion, such that any moving object has Kinetic Energy based on how fast it is going. Potential Energy can be thought of as energy that can be used to move. A ball sitting on a table has Potential Energy based on how high it is off the ground.<br><br>One of the most important laws in science is the Law of Conservation of Energy. This law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be transformed from one form of energy to another. Consider a roller coaster as an example:<br><img src=\"\/content-assets\/science-test-1\/339-1.png\" \/><br>The roller coaster car starts at point A with no velocity. At point A, the car has Potential Energy proportional to its height (h) but no Kinetic Energy because it is not moving, so its velocity, or speed, is 0. As the roller coaster car rolls down to point B it gains Kinetic Energy as its velocity increases, but loses Potential Energy as its height decreases. At point B, all of the Potential Energy from Point A has been converted to Kinetic Energy. Kinetic Energy is at a maximum, and Potential Energy is zero at point B.",
