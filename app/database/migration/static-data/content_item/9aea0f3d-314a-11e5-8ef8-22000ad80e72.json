Taking samples and temperature readings from multiple places in the lake gives the researcher multiple trials to compare. If the researcher only samples one location, there might be an unknown factor affecting that location. Taking samples on days of different temperature throughout the year provides the independent variable in the test; the water has to be different temperatures to test the theory.<\/p>",
