    "prompt": "In late December of 1890, in a continued government attempt to stop the Ghost Dance religion among the Lacota Sioux, 500 soldiers contained 350 Lacota followers of Big Foot (including 120 women and children) in a camp at Wounded Knee. When the soldiers went to disarm the Lacota, a scuffle began between soldiers and a deaf man named Black Coyote. Based on the incident resulting in Sitting Bull\u2019s death, what was likely to happen? ",

The incident with Big Foot is similar. Although the Native Americans were outnumbered by the soldiers, based on the incident with Sitting Bull, any scuffle or conflict would likely result in a gunfight between the two factions. The resulting gunfight at Wounded Knee became known as the Wounded Knee Massacre, with 150 Lacota Sioux and 25 soldiers killed in the fight.",
