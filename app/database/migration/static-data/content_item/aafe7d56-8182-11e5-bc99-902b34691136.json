Has my little <b>spendthrift<\/b> been <b>wasting money<\/b> again?\u201d He is pleasant, but he\u2019s clearly displeased. He scolds her almost like a child, and his lecture about borrowing shows that he is serious about not spending money. \u201cNo debt, no borrowing,\u201d expresses Torvald\u2019s attitude toward money. He wants Nora to keep spending within their means. If Nora spent the money Torvald gave her right away, she would not be keeping her spending within their means. He would likely have a similar reaction, to scold Nora for spending the money.",
