Some of these variations arise from genetic differences and are passed down to subsequent generations. Other variations can be acquired over a lifetime and are not passed down through the generations. Still other variations are a combination of genetic inheritance and acquisition over a lifetime.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Which characteristic is only genetically inherited?<\/b><\/p>",
