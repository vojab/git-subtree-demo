This idea can be tested. The variation in meristematic cell size is data that the scientist already collected. The idea that meristematic cells vary in size is also shown from the data the scientist has. It could be a conclusion from the data, but it\u2019s not a hypothesis the scientist might test. The idea that every meristematic stem cell has a measureable length is also not a hypothesis.\r\n",
