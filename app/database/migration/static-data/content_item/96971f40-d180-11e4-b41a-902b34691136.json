The two blocks together have a combined mass of 2 + 3 = 5 kg, and the acceleration due to gravity is roughly 10 m\/s<sup>2<\/sup>. The table pushes up with the same downward force exerted by gravity on the two books. Therefore,  the upward force exerted on the books by the table is f = ma = (2 + 3)10 = 5(10) = 50N.",
