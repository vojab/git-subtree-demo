When a baseball player sees a ball, visual information about the location of the ball is transmitted through the optic nerves (from the eyes) to the brain. The brain then coordinates the movement of the muscular system, the muscles that move different parts of the body, to allow the player to jump and place his hand in the path of the ball. The nervous system and the muscular system work together for the player to catch a fly ball.",
