It\u2019s a fair generalization that the author disliked the acting in the play.<\/p>\r\n<br\/>\r\nWhat is highly suspect is the performance of Mark Karline as Giles Ralston, whose<b>overdone acting was unbelievable.<\/b> Jess Morgan performed as a <b>lukewarm<\/b> Mollie, and the chemistry between the two was non-existent. Major Metcalf is played by Storm Rocklander, who seems to distinctly enjoy making strange faces at the audience that <b>ruin the effect of a play.<\/b> Detective Sergeant Trotter, played by Karl Freiheim, gave a solid performance but struggled against the rest of the cast, outstanding only in its mediocrity. Director Amy Welsch could not pull together her cast to give this drama the performances it deserved.",
