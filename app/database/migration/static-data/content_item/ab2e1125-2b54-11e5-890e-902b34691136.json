I am ten thousand times more so, since I have seen what they are. There is scarcely an evil known in these countries, which may not be traced to their king, as its source, nor a good, which is not derived from the small fibres of republicanism existing among them.\u201d\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nThomas Jefferson, letter to General Washington, May 2, 1788",

The idea that monarchies are unfair is restated in Jefferson\u2019s letter to Washington and the idea that republican governments could survive started to take hold across Europe, starting in 1789 with the French Revolution.",
