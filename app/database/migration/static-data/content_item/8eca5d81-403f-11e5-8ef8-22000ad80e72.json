The air rockets are launched by air pressure built up with a bicycle pump. The student pumps air into the launch pad, and when the pressure reaches a certain level, the rocket launches itself. Student groups record the data in the table.<\/p>\r\n<b><p>What is one possible source of error that might have caused such different results?<\/p><\/b>",
