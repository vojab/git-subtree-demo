Energy may change forms, such as from potential energy to kinetic energy, but the amount of energy remains the same.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-weight:normal\">A student performed an experiment where a ball was let go at 12 inches, 24 inches, 36 inches, and 48 inches on the u-shaped track shown in the illustration. The student measured how far the ball went up the opposite side of the track. The student found that the ball always traveled up the opposite side to the height from which it was dropped.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>How does this experiment relate to the law of conservation of energy?<\/p>\r\n",

As the ball moves down the track, the potential energy changes to kinetic energy, and the ball moves faster. As the ball travels up the other side, the kinetic energy changes to potential energy. Because the amount of energy never changes, the ball stops at the same height from which it was dropped.<\/p>",
