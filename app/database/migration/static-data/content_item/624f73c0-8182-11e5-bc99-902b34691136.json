He refers to it again in the next sentence, calling it the \u201cgreat task remaining before us\u201d and \u201cthat cause.\u201d It is not until the end of the speech that he identifies the cause, \u201cthat this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people [that is, the democratic government] shall not perish from the earth.\u201d\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\nBut, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate\u2026we cannot consecrate\u2026we cannot hallow\u2026this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the <strong>unfinished work<\/strong> which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the <strong>great task remaining before us<\/strong>\u2026that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to <strong>that cause<\/strong> for which they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; <strong>that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.<\/strong>",
