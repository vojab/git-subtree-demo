    "prompt": "In studying earthquakes, seismologists have found that soft soil amplifies, or increases, ground shaking. Other factors that affect the amount of shaking at a particular location include the size of the earthquake and how close the site is to the fault where the earthquake occurs. If Krista is considering building a house in an area that has many earthquakes, which of the following locations is the best place to build?",

The second factor, the size of the earthquake, cannot be predicted. The third factor is how close the site is to a fault. A site relatively far from the fault where an earthquake occurs will experience less shaking. The site with hard soil relatively far from fault lines is the best building site.<\/p>\r\n<br\/>\r\nIn studying earthquakes, seismologists have found that <b>soft soil amplifies, or increases, ground shaking.<\/b> Other factors that affect the amount of shaking at a particular location include the size of the earthquake <b>and how close the site is to the fault<\/b> where the earthquake occurs.",
