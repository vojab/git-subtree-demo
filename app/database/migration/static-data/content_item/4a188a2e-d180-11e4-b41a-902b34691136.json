    "feedback": "The correct answer is \"is.\" The sentence should read: \u201cThe maintenance staff is responsible for building systems during power outages and will shut off sensitive building equipment.\u201d The subject \u201cstaff\u201d might be confusing because it is a group noun. It describes a group of people. However, group nouns such as \u201cstaff,\u201d \u201ccompany,\u201d \u201ccouple,\u201d or \u201cfamily\u201d are typically singular. The correct verb is the singular verb \u201cis.\u201d",
