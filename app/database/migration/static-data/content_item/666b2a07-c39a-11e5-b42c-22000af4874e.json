    "description": "<p>My favorite bean dip is easy to make, and everybody loves it. You can use any kind of bean soup, salsa, and cheese that you like, so it\u2019s easy to make with what you have on hand. All you need is: a can of refried beans, a can of bean soup, a jar of salsa, and shredded cheese. First, you need to heat up the oven to 400 degrees. Then mix the beans, bean soup, and salsa in a casserole dish. Then, top with cheese, and pop it in the oven for twenty minutes. Add jalapeno peppers, olives, sour cream, or other toppings if you like! Just serve with your favorite chips.<\/p>",

    "feedback": "Formatting in a recipe helps people use it easily in the kitchen, and keep track of the steps and ingredients they\u2019re using. Without formatting, this recipe might be difficult to follow. It would improve this recipe to break it up into an introduction, ingredients, and directions. It would also be helpful to organize the ingredients into a list, so it would be easier to get the ingredients together. It would also help to organize the directions as a numbered list, to keep track of the steps.\r\n",
