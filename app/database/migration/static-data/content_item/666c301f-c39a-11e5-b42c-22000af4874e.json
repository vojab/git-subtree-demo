A touchscreen and a monitor are both output devices that show you your programs, files, and images... they give you visual output from your computer. A headset also gives you output, but the output is sound.

A keyboard is the only choice that\u2019s never an output device... a keyboard doesn\u2019t change depending on your computer... it\u2019s an input device where you can give your computer information and instructions, not an output device where you get information from your computer.\r\n",
