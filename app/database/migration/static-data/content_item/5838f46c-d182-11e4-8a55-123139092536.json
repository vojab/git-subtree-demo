    "feedback": "The correct answer is \"your personal workspace.\" The sentence should read: \u201cAs an employee, you are responsible for your personal workspace.\u201d In this sentence, the word \u201cyour\u201d is a possessive pronoun meaning \u201cbelonging to you.\u201d The spelling \u201cyou\u2019re\u201d is a contraction that means \u201cyou are.\u201d Saying \u201cyou are personal workspace\u201d would clearly be wrong. The correct spelling is \u201cyour.\u201d You also need to choose the correct spelling of the commonly confused words \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cpersonnel.\u201d The word \u201cpersonnel\u201d is incorrect; it means employees or workers. The word \u201cpersonal\u201d is correct. It means belonging to a particular person.",
