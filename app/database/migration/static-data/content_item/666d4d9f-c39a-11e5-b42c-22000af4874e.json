Longer passwords are also more secure than shorter passwords. Shorter passwords are easier to find using computer programs that try random combinations.<\/p>\r\n<p>Passwords should not have complete, recognizable words in them. Complete words make passwords easier to find. Also, using the same password on several sites is insecure. If one password is compromised, all of the sites using that password are compromised. Finally, secure passwords should use symbols like $ or %, if they are allowed by the site. Special characters make passwords harder to find.<\/p>",
