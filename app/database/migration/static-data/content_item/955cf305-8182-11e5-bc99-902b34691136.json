    "prompt": "This image shows the Gulf Stream, a flow of warm current through the Atlantic Ocean that warms the climate in Europe. One hypothesis says that melting arctic ice from global warming could cool the Gulf Stream and stop or change its flow. Which of the following might be a result if the Gulf Stream stopped flowing?",

    "feedback": "Stornoway in northern England and Hopedale in northern Canada have very different climates, although they are at the same latitude. The map shows tundra just north of Hopedale, while areas near to Stornoway are alpine. The Gulf Stream is responsible for warming the climate in Europe. If the Gulf Stream\u2019s influence were removed, Europe would likely become colder. Since Stornoway and Hopedale are at the same latitude, they would likely have the same climate without the influence of the Gulf Stream.<img src='\/uploads\/assessments\/3378\/nhj4fb923397.png' alt='Answer Explanation Image'>",
