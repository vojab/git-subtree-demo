    "prompt": "Students wanted to compare the different levels of concentration in salt-water, sugar-water and distilled water by submerging gummy bears in each solution. The masses and volumes of gummy bears in all three solutions changed. What conclusion can be reached from this evidence?",
    "description": "Osmosis is the process in which water moves through a semi-permeable membrane, such as a plant or animal cell, from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration of water. Different solutions, such as salt-water and sugar-water, have different levels of concentration.",

    "feedback": "Mass and Volume are directly related, so both are equally important variables. The bears that increased the most in mass and volume did so because they were in the solution with the greatest difference in water concentration between them and the solution.",
