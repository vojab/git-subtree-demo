    "prompt": "<p>Specific heat capacity is a measure of how much thermal energy, or heat, a material can hold. It is measured by the amount of thermal energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram (1 g) of a substance by one degree Celsius (1\u00b0C). It takes more heat to increase the temperature of a substance with a high specific heat capacity than a substance with a low specific heat capacity. The graph below shows the temperature change of equal amounts of five different liquids heated with the same method for four minutes.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Which liquid has the highest specific heat?<\/b><\/p>",

The same amount of heat energy was absorbed by each liquid. Therefore, the liquid whose temperature increased the least has the highest specific heat capacity. Liquid A increased the least of all the liquids for the same amount of energy, so liquid A has the highest specific heat capacity.<img src='\/uploads\/assessments\/1373\/pozgmffk1384.png' alt='Answer Explanation Image'>",
