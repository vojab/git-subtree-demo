If the store started selling a fourth print for $45, by how many dollars would the median cost of the posters change?\r\n<br\/>\r\nEnter your answer using the circles in the alternate answer format grid.",

    "feedback": "The median cost of the prints would change by $5. The median, or middle, cost of the three original prints is $35. When a fourth price is added to the list of prices, the median is the number halfway between the two middle prices. The price halfway between $35 and $45 is $40, so $40 is the new median price. The median price has changed from $35 to $40, a difference of $5.",
