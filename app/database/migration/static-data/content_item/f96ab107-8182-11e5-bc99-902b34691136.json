The first square has one dot. The second has two, and the third has three. The next square should have four dots. That means the answer will be either Square C or Square D. Second, the pattern goes left-right-left. The first square has dots on the left. The second has dots on the right, and the third has dots on the left. The next square should have dots on the right. Square D has four dots on the right side, so Square D is the best answer.",
