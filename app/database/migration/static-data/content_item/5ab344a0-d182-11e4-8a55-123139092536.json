    "feedback": "The correct answer is \"haven\u2019t had any.\" The sentence should read: \u201cMost schools haven\u2019t had any experience with interactive whiteboards.\u201d This question asks you to choose the correct phrase in standard English. The word \u201cain\u2019t\u201d is non-standard English and so is \u201chaven\u2019t had no.\u201d People might use non-standard English in casual conversation, but in formal writing such as a business letter, the correct phrase is \u201chaven\u2019t had any.\u201d",
