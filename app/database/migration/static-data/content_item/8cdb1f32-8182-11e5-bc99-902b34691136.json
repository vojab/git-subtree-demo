    "prompt": "The diagram illustrates Newton\u2019s first law of motion, that an object at rest tends to stay at rest, and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction, unless acted upon by a net outside force. The skateboarder falls forward after hitting a rock, while the skateboard stops. Which statement explains this result?",

    "feedback": "Both the skateboard and the skateboarder are moving forward at the same speed before the skateboard collides with the rock. According to Newton\u2019s first law of motion, an object at rest tends to stay at rest, and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction, unless acted upon by a net outside force. In other words, unless something interferes, the skateboard and the skateboarder will continue to move forward. The rock interferes with the skateboard\u2019s forward movement, stopping it from moving forward. The skateboarder is not stopped by the rock. He is still in motion, and he moves forward until the force of gravity pulls him to the ground.<img src='\/uploads\/assessments\/3378\/bldqq9ea3381.png' alt='Answer Explanation Image'>",
