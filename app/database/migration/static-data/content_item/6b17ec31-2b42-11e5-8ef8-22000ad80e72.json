The previous sentence reads: \u201cBecause the anode and cathode become unbalanced (with more electrons at the anode than the cathode), extra electrons are pushed away from the anode.\u201d The electrons are pushed away. The next sentence states that the electrolyte stops the electrons from moving in the direction they\u2019re pushed. These two sentences contrast each other. The best transition word is \u201chowever.\u201d",
