    "prompt": "Because maggots would often appear in meat, early observers thought that maggots spontaneously generated, or came to life without being born, from dead animal flesh. In 1668, though, Italian Francesco Redi did experiments in which he prevented flies from laying eggs in meat. His experiments showed that no maggots appeared in meat when flies did not lay eggs. Redi\u2019s experiment was an important step for science because ",
