It explains how much stronger their sense of smell is than human smell, and it explains that the olfactory bulb in the brain is five times larger than the area in a human brain. The best introductory sentence introduces the same topic: \u201cBears are believed to have the strongest sense of smell of any animal on earth.\u201d The incorrect responses mention that bears are strong, that bears leave behind their scent, and that humans should not leave food where bears might get it.
