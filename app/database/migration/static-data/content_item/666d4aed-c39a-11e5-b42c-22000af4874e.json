If all comments had to have a real name and verified email attached to them, would we see so much casual sexism, racism, bigotry and homophobia?\u201d",

    "feedback": "Many people complain that anonymity on the Internet causes people to be mean-spirited or cruel in their comments. Clair is making this same point. One solution is to make sure that people who comment use their real names and can be tied to their comments, and a common way to do this is by having users log in through their Facebook account to leave a comment.",
