Blue light has a wavelength of about 475 nm, and green light has a wavelength of about 510 nm.<\/p> \r\n<p><b>Which is probably closest to the wavelength of yellow light?<\/b><\/p>",

    "feedback": "Looking at the continuum of colors, the leftmost end would correspond to the lowest number on the scale, 400. Green has a wavelength of 510, and since yellow is just to the right of green on the continuum, you would expect yellow to have a wavelength of a little more than green. So, 570 nm is the best answer choice.",
