A simple calendar wouldn\u2019t be copyrighted, because the progression of days and months is common knowledge. A digital version of the Declaration of Independence is a copy of a public domain work, so there is no copyright. The same is true of a photograph of a painting from 1649. The painting is old enough that the copyright would be expired.\r\n",
