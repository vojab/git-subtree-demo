    "description": "The theory of homeostasis says the body has several processes that respond to each other in order to maintain the body at its normal condition, such as maintaining a body temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37\u00b0C). Some students are conducting an experiment to determine if heart rate and blood pressure help regulate body temperature. Their hypothesis is that if the body is exposed to hot temperatures the heart rate and blood pressure will increase in order to reduce body temperature to normal. To conduct the experiment, the test subject will place both arms into a tub of hot water at 120 degrees Fahrenheit, about the temperature of a hot shower. To gather data, the students plan to use a thermometer to measure skin temperature of the arm in the water tub. Another thermometer will measure the body temperature in the mouth. An electronic blood pressure cuff will take frequent measurements of pulse rate and blood pressure.",

    "feedback": "The students predicted that blood pressure and pulse rate would decrease in response to elevated body temperatures. When the test subject's body temperature increased, the pulse rate increased, but the blood pressure decreased. So the hypothesis was partially supported by the experiment and partially refuted.",
