This web page is on www.usa.gov \u2026 The dot-gov means this is a government website, and \u201cUSA\u201d should give you a clue that it\u2019s the United States government. The next part of the URL is \u201ccitizens.\u201d That probably means this information is for U.S. citizens--but that\u2019s pretty general information. The last part of the URL is \u201cholidays.shtml\u201d so the page is probably about holidays. All the answer choices are about holidays, but the only one that\u2019s likely on a U.S. government website is information about commonly celebrated U.S. holidays. That\u2019s the best answer.\r\n",
