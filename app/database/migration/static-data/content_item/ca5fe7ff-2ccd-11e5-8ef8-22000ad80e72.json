If you don't know how to answer a question, leave it blank and go on to the next question. Guessing is a good idea on most high school equivalency tests, but for this test, we really want to understand what you know. If you are unsure of an answer and want to think about it, you can click \u201cReview Question Later\u201d to come back to the question later.<\/p>\r\n<p>There are 25 questions on the test. These questions will give you practice with the types of questions you will see on writing high-school equivalency tests.<\/p>\r\n<p>Relax and do your best!<\/p>",
