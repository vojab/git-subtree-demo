In the choice \u201cGilman may have documented her own post-partum depression, which is often regarded as semi-autobiographical, in this story,\u201d the phrase appears to modify \u201cdepression,\u201d which is also incorrect. \u201cThis story often being regarded as semi-autobiographical\u201d is awkward sentence structure.\r\n",
