    "description": "The chart shows federal revenue and federal spending for a selected range of years.<br><br>\r\nThe term \"starve the beast\" refers to an economic and political idea that high tax revenue leads to increased government spending and that, conversely, lower tax revenue will lead to decreased government spending.",

    "feedback": "The \"starve the beast\" idea says that if taxes are higher, the government will spend more. Data opposed to this idea would show that when revenue goes up, spending goes down, and when revenue goes down, spending goes up. The data in the chart refutes the \"starve the beast\" theory. When tax revenue increases, spending decreases. When tax revenue decreases, spending increases.",
