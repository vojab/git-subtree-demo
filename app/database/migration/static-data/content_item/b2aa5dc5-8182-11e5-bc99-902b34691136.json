    "feedback": "<p>While both stanzas are from the point of view of the mirror, the first stanza describes the mirror\u2019s self-perception. The mirror is silver; it is exact. It reflects things truthfully. It reflects the pink wall on the other side of the room most of the time, and its reflection of the pink wall is broken on and off by faces and darkness. The pronoun \u201cI\u201d appears throughout the stanza. The second stanza, though, describes the woman\u2019s interaction with the mirror. She looks in the mirror, wondering who she really is. She cries and waves her hands. She looks in the mirror each morning. The focus of this stanza is not on the mirror, but on the woman. The pronouns \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cher\u201d appear throughout the stanza.<\/p>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>I<\/b> am silver and exact. <b>I<\/b> have no preconceptions.<br \/>\r\nWhatever <b>I<\/b> see, <b>I<\/b> swallow immediately.<br \/>\r\njust as it is, unmisted by love or dislike<br \/>\r\n<b>I<\/b> am not cruel, only truthful\u2014<br \/>\r\nThe eye of a little god, four-cornered.<br \/>\r\nMost of the time <b>I<\/b> meditate on the opposite wall.<br \/>\r\nIt is pink, with speckles. <b>I<\/b> have looked at it so long<br \/>\r\n<b>I<\/b> think it is a part of my heart.
