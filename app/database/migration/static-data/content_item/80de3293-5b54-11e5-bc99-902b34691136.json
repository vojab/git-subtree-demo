    "feedback": "The sentence is correct as it is. The word \u201cstudents\u201d does not need an apostrophe.  Apostrophes are used to indicate possession. For example, you would add an apostrophe and the letter \u2018s\u2019 to a singular noun that doesn\u2019t end in \u2018s\u2019 to show possession. For example, you would write, \u201cthe man\u2019s boat.\u201d The example in this question does not show possession, and so an apostrophe is not needed. It is a plural noun addressing the class. The answer choices that capitalize \u201calgebra\u201d and \u201cexam\u201d are also incorrect. The words \u201calgebra\u201d and \u201cexam\u201d are not proper nouns and do not need to be capitalized.",
