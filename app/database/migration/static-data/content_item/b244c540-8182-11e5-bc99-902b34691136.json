It reflects honestly everything \u201cjust as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.\u201d The mirror is faithful, showing the woman how she really looks. She responds with tears, because she dislikes how she looks. She prefers the \u201cliars,\u201d candles and the moon, that can hide her flaws in soft light. Answer A is correct; the woman cries because she doesn\u2019t like how she looks.",
