A proper noun is the name of a specific individual, organization, place, or object, such as \u201cCesar Chavez,\u201d \u201cPresident Truman,\u201d \u201cUnited Nations,\u201d \u201cBaghdad,\u201d or \u201cWorld Health Organization.\u201d \u201cMarketing\u201d is not at the beginning of the sentence, and it is not a proper noun. \u201cMarketing\u201d should not be capitalized, and so answer E is correct.<\/p>\r\n<br\/>\r\nI know that Amanda hopes to move into a more responsible position in <b>marketing,<\/b> and I believe that she is up to the task.",
