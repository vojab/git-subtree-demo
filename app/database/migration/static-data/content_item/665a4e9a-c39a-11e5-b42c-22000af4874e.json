    "description": "<p>For a chemical equation to be balanced, the number of atoms on one side of the equation must equal the number of atoms on the other side. The arrangement of atoms change, but the number of atoms stays the same.<\/p>",

    "order": 11,
    "time_limit": null,
    "feedback": "The correct answer is 2. The methane molecule has four hydrogen atoms (H) and one carbon atom (C). The two oxygen molecules together have four oxygen atoms (O). The other side of the equation needs the same number of atoms. The carbon dioxide molecule has one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. That leaves four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms. There must be two water molecules to have four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms.\r\n",
