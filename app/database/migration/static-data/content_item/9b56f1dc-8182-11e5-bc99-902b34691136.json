    "prompt": "An animal will only have a recessive trait if it has two copies of the same recessive gene. If a dog has only one recessive gene for a genetic disorder, will the dog\u2019s natural child from sexual reproduction or a clone be more likely to show the trait?",

    "feedback": "The clone will have the exact same genetic code as the dog. That means, the clone will have only one recessive gene, and it will definitely not have the recessive trait. On the other hand, the natural offspring will get genes from the father and mother. It may inherit the recessive gene from the father, and it also might inherit a recessive gene from the mother. The natural offspring might or might not show the recessive trait. That makes it more likely to have the trait than the clone, which definitely will not have the trait.<img src='\/uploads\/assessments\/3408\/7cgxba2f3413.png' alt='Answer Explanation Image'>",
