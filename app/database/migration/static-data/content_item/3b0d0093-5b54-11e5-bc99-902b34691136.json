When it is taken to the watchmaker, he 'pushes up' the regulator to make the watch run faster, since the watch seems slow. Since the watch wasn\u2019t slow, but just set incorrectly, this makes the watch go too fast.  From that point forward, each time the narrator takes the watch to be fixed, something else goes wrong. The watch seems to get worse and worse.",
