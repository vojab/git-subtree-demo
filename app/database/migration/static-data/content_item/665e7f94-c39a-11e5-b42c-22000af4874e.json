He proposes that the law be changed to state clearly that copyrighted works can be used in works of art, as long as they are not simply reproduced without alteration.

This proposed change to the law gives more rights to those who want to use creative works, and takes away some control from those who want to control copyrighted work. Among these answers, the movie company that doesn\u2019t want clips of its films used in other works would likely be against this change. The movie company would have to give up some control over their films and how they were used.\r\n",
