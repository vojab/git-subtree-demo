    "description": "The diagram illustrates the economic rule of supply and demand. According to the economic law of supply and demand, at higher prices people want (demand) lower quantities. At higher prices, businesses want to make (supply) larger quantities. The equilibrium point, where supply and demand meet, gives the price the item should sell for on an open market.",

    "feedback": "Supply and demand are two forces of a free economic market that help set the price of an item. If a toy is popular, it has high demand. If there is a shortage, the supply is low. Both of these factors will work together to increase the price. A shortage of a particular toy means a low supply and high demand, and the law of supply and demand says that the price of the toy will go up. None of the variables cited in the incorrect answers relate to the law of supply and demand.",
