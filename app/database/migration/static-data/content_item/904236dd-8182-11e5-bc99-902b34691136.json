    "prompt": "The placement of eyes on a skull can help scientists understand an animal\u2019s lifestyle. In general, eye orbits toward the sides of the skull, facing left and right, indicate prey animals. This placement provides a wide field of vision for prey animals to watch for predators. Eye orbits toward the front of the skull, facing forward, usually indicate predators. The position of the eyes close together helps a predator focus on and track prey. Based on the information, which is the best conclusion about these skulls?",

The eyes in skull A face to the side, and are most easily seen in the side view of the skull, so skull A is probably a prey animal. The eyes in skull B face forward and are most easily seen in the top view of the skull, so skull B is probably a predator.\r\n<br\/><img src='\/uploads\/assessments\/3378\/q3xnhvja3387.png' alt='Answer Explanation Image'>",
