Although Lincoln is making a speech about the opening of a cemetery for fallen soldiers, he is also in the midst of a war. He want to maintain support for the Civil War. That\u2019s why Lincoln says that \u201cwe here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.\u201d He appeals to the people to honor the dead soldiers by uniting in support of the Civil War and the ultimate unification of the United States, which will continue the American ideals of government Lincoln talks about.",
