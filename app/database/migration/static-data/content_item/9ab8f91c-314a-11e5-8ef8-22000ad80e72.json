The engineer hypothesizes that the wall construction will withstand earthquakes 10% stronger than what current construction methods can withstand. The engineer\u2019s lab has a simulation chamber that is built to simulate various types of earthquake shaking at varying magnitudes on scale models.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Design a controlled experiment that the engineer can use to test this hypothesis. Include descriptions of the data collected and how the engineer will determine if the hypothesis is correct.<\/p>",
