The sugar water temporarily keeps the ladybugs from flying so that they establish their territories in the garden. The gardener sprays the ladybugs and then releases them. This way, the ladybugs will not be able to fly off immediately. While the sugar water prevents them from leaving, the ladybugs make homes in the garden. Ladybugs make a home and then protect it, and they need time to adapt to the garden as their territory.<\/p>\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\n<b>Ladybugs are territorial<\/b> insects that can be effective pest control, since they eat aphids, mites, mealybugs, and other similar pests. In the past, a gardener has ordered ladybugs from a garden supply store, but when he released them in his garden, they immediately flew <b>off before they could adapt to his garden as their territory.<\/b> The gardener has read that if he sprays a solution of sugar water on ladybugs\u2019 wings before he releases them, the sugar water will temporarily stop them from flying without harming them, and the ladybugs will stay in his garden.",
