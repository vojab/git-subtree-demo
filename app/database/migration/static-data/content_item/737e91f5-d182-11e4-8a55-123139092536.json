    "prompt": "<p>Specific heat capacity is a measure of how much thermal energy, or heat, a material can hold. It is measured by the amount of thermal energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram (1 g) of a substance by one degree Celsius (1 C). It takes more heat to increase the temperature of a substance with a high specific heat capacity than a substance with a low specific heat capacity. The graph below shows the temperature change of equal amounts of five different liquids heated with the same method for four minutes.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>If each liquid had approximately the same boiling point, which liquid would take the least amount of energy to bring to a boil?<\/b><\/p>",

    "feedback": "Liquid E has the lowest specific heat of these liquids. Therefore it takes less energy to raise the temperature of the liquid by one degree Celsius. This is true for any number of degrees Celsius. The assumption is that the boiling points are all the same, so the liquids' temperatures must all be raised by the same amount. It will take less energy to increase the temperature of the low specific heat liquid, liquid E, than a liquid with a higher specific heat.<img src='\/uploads\/assessments\/1373\/8bua5rvw1385.png' alt='Answer Explanation Image'>",
