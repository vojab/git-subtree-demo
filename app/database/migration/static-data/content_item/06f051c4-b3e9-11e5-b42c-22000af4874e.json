    "prompt": "<p>To the left of this prompt, you will find two articles in which the authors put forth differing perspectives on voting rights for felons. Read both passages carefully, noting the strengths and weaknesses of each discussion. Then, write an essay in which you explain your own position on the issue of whether or not felons should be allowed to vote and under what circumstances.<\/p>\r\n<p>Be sure to use evidence from the text passages provided as well as specific reasons and examples from your own experience and knowledge to support your position. Remember that every position exists within the context of a larger discussion of the issue, so your essay should, at minimum, acknowledge alternate and\/or opposing ideas. When you have finished your essay, review your writing to check for correct spelling, punctuation, and grammar.<\/p>\r\n",
