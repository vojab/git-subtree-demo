    "description": "Click the <u>one best answer<\/u> to each question.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\nA simple lever can be constructed by laying a bar over a fulcrum, or pivot point. The longer the distance between the fulcrum and the force end of the bar, the less force is needed to lift the weight on the other end. A boy wants to play on a seesaw with his father, but the boy is not heavy enough to lift his father off the ground by sitting at one end. The father realizes that the seesaw is a lever. With the father sitting at one end, the center of the seesaw sits on a fulcrum.",

To lift the same load with less force, the fulcrum needs to be closer to the load. The closer to the load that the fulcrum is, the less force is needed to lift the weight.<img src='http:\/\/app.essentialed.com\/uploads\/assessments\/3378\/4qvbnoo23393.png' alt='Answer Explanation Image'>",
