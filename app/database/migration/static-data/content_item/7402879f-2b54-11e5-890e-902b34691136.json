    "prompt": "<p style=\"font-weight:normal\">Researchers conducted an experiment for a new drug intended to treat a respiratory disorder. The test was undertaken over a one week period.  During this time, three hundred participants lived and slept in a controlled environment and were continually monitored. Half of the participants were given no drug, but were simply monitored as a control group. The other half of the participants were given the proposed drug treatment. By the end of the study, the experimental group showed a 12% improvement in lung function over the control group. The researchers concluded that the drug is a valid treatment for the respiratory disorder.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which of the following would be the best improvement to this experiment?<\/p>",

If neither the control group or the experimental group knows who is receiving the treatment, the placebo effect has equal potential to affect either group, thus diminishing it as a factor. <\/p>\r\n",
