    "prompt": "<p>The concept of natural selection was first developed by Charles Darwin in the 1800s and presented in his book \"The Origin of Species\" in 1859. The peppered moths that live near industrial cities in England are a well-documented example of natural selection, the process in nature by which organisms best adapted to their environment survive and reproduce. The colors of peppered moths vary from light to dark. In the 1800s, black smoke from burning coal killed the lichen that grew on local trees and darkened the bark. The darker moths were harder for the birds that ate them to see on the darker trees, and so the dark moths more often lived longer and reproduced. By 1895, 98% of the moths in the vicinity of English industrial cities were almost completely black. In modern times, air pollution controls have changed the environment again. Since the 1950s, the amount of heavy particulate air pollutants reaching the trees has lessened, and lichen has grown back.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Based on the information given and assuming the theory of Natural Selection is true, which of the following hypotheses is the most logical?<\/b><\/p?",
