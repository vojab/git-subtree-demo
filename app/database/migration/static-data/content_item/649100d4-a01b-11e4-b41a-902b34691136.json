The company will pay eligible employees 25% of child day care costs, up to a maximum of $500 per month. \r\nIf an employee has two children in day care at a cost of $500 per child per month, how much will the employee receive in company day care benefits per year?",

    "feedback": "The answer is $3,000. To find out the employee\u2019s costs, you must multiply the number of children in day care times the cost of day care. The employee is paying day care for 2 children, at $500 per month, per child. Over the course of 12 months, the employee will pay 2 times 500 times 12 for day care, or $12,000. The company pays 25%. 25% of $12,000 is $3,000. This is less than the maximum of $500 per month, or $6000 a year, so the answer is $3000.",
