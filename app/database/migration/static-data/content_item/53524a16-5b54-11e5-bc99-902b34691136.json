This type of explanatory phrase is called an \u201cappositive.\u201d It tells you something about Jon but isn\u2019t necessary to the rest of the sentence. An appositive is set off by commas before and after it.<\/p>\r\n<p>This sentence is incorrect: \u201cThe welding company, Welders Inc. employs 50 people.\u201d The company name \u201cWelders Inc.\u201d is also an appositive, so it should have a comma after it as well as one before it.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the sentence \u201cMarco Jon's boss, helps him learn,\u201d the appositive is \u201cJon\u2019s boss.\u201d It explains more about Marco. It should have a comma before it as well as one after it.<\/p>\r\n<p>This sentence is also incorrect: \u201cA demanding job welding, requires special skills.\u201d In this sentence \u201ca demanding job\u201d explains more about welding. It should be set off by a comma after it, since it comes at the beginning of the sentence. The subject of the sentence is \u201cwelding,\u201d and the subject should not be separated from the verb by a comma. This sentence should read: \u201cA demanding job, welding requires special skills.\u201d<\/p>",
