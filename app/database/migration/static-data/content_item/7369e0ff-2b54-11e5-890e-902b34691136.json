    "prompt": "<span style=\"font-weight:normal\">Researchers conducted an experiment for a new drug intended to treat a respiratory disorder. The test was undertaken over a one week period.  During this time, three hundred participants lived and slept in a controlled environment and were continually monitored. Half of the participants were given no drug, but were simply monitored as a control group. The other half of the participants were given the proposed drug treatment. By the end of the study, the experimental group showed a 12% improvement in lung function over the control group. The researchers concluded that the drug is a valid treatment for the respiratory disorder. <\/span><br \/><br \/>\r\n\r\nWhat are the independent and dependent variables of this experiment?<br \/><br \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight:normal\">Independent Variable: <\/span>![dropdown:Drop_Down_3072_251]<br \/>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight:normal\">Dependent Variable: <\/span>![dropdown:Drop_Down_3072_252]",
