The most common meaning of the word <u>effect<\/u> is a noun meaning a situation caused by something. When you <u>affect<\/u> something, it has an <u>effect<\/u>.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\naffect (verb) to influence\r\n<br\/>\r\neffect (noun) a situation caused by something\r\n<br\/>\r\nWhen you <u>affect<\/u> something, it has an <u>effect<\/u>.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\nTo decide which word to use, decide whether the word is a noun or a verb. Could you say \u201caffected\u201d if the sentence were in the past tense? It sounds wrong, so the word is not a verb. Another clue is that the word is plural. It is a noun, so the correct word is \u201ceffects.\u201d\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\nLeaving a job can have long-term <u>positive or negative <b>effects<\/b><\/u> on your career.",
