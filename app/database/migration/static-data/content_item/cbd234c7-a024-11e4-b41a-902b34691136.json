    "description": "Below are two graphs. The first one shows the world wide consumption of oil over several recent decades. The second graph represents the average concentration of Carbon Dioxide \\(CO_{2}\\) in the atmosphere, as measured over the middle of the Pacific Ocean, across approximately the same time period as the first graph. Carbon Dioxide is a known by product from the combustion, burning, of fossil fuels like oil.",

    "feedback": "The two graphs show a similar increasing trend over the same period of time. This suggests that there is  a relationship between burning oil and the amount of carbon dioxide.",
