    "feedback": "Acceleration is the pull of force felt when an object is speeding up or slowing down. An object that is speeding up has positive acceleration. An object that is slowing down has negative acceleration. In casual conversation you might use the term deceleration to describe negative acceleration, but in physics both are described with the word acceleration. Inertia is a property of matter where an object in uniform motion continues in its existing state until it is changed by an external force.",
