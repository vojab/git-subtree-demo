They suggest that the Internet changes the way we read and therefore the way we think. These critics point out that information on the Internet is designed to be consumed in small, bite-sized chunks. It is often presented in short, pithy blocks of text peppered with hyperlinks and images. They argue that consuming information in short bursts and leaping from link to link builds habits that are reshaping our minds.<\/p>",

The other responses diverge from the critique of the internet and instead offer positive aspects. Whether or not these positive aspects are true, they are not the focus of this paragraph. \r\n",
