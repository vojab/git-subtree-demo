The writer is talking about the needs of the school. The words \u201cthank you\u201d don\u2019t need quotation marks because it\u2019s not a direct quote. They also don\u2019t need a hyphen since it is not being used as an adjective. You might include a hyphen if it were being used as an adjective, such as \u201ca thank-you card,\u201d but that\u2019s not the case here.\r\n",
