The phrase \u201cschool\u2019s needs\u201d means the needs of the school. The word \u201cschool\u201d should be singular possessive. To form a singular possessive from a word that doesn\u2019t end in \u2018s,\u2019 add an apostrophe \u2018s\u2019 at the end of the word: \u201cschool\u2019s.\u201d",
