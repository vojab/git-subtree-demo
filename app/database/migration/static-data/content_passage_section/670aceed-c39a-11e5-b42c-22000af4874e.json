    "contents": "For many years, Las Vegas and Atlantic City had monopolies on gambling in the United States. Now, with state lotteries, online gambling, riverboat gambling, and Native American casinos, most Americans are relatively close to legalized gambling. Why is gambling still prohibited in so many areas and stifled with regulation? The reasons are cultural, rooted in moral objections and fear of addiction.
