    "contents": "<p>The African diaspora is the dispersion of African people and their descendants throughout the world. The majority of the African diaspora was caused by the practice of slavery, which moved many Africans to the Western Hemisphere, affecting the population of the Americas today. Jamaica exemplifies the impact of the African diaspora on modern demographics. Between 1655 and 1838, Jamaica was a British colony, and the base of its economy was sugar plantations run by African slave labor. The amount of labor needed to run a large sugar plantation was high. By 1800, the African slave population outnumbered European settlers by an estimated 300,000 to 30,000. Today, Jamaica\u2019s populace of around 2.75 million reflects this colonial demographic, with a population that is 90.9% black.<\/p>",
