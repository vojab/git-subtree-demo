    "contents": "Comedian Jon Stewart, who was born in New Jersey and has a television show based in New York, calls Chicago-style pizza \u201ctomato soup in a bread bowl,\u201d among other not-so-flattering names. Chicagoans, proud of their version of the dish, like to disparage New York pizza as \u201cdeflated pizza\u201d or \u201climp pizza\u201d because it lacks the bulk and substance of the deep dish variety. Which kind is best? Stewart thinks the answer can be found in the name. In Chicago, he says, people have to use extra words, referring to it as \u201cdeep-dish\u201d pizza, or \u201cChicago-style\u201d pizza. \u201cIn New York, you know what we call it?\u201d asks Stewart. \u201cPizza.\u201d",
