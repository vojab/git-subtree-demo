During the intervening time the Japanese Government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nThe attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. Very many American lives have been lost. In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nJapan has therefore undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the Pacific area. The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves. The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our nation.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nAs Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense, that always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught against us.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nHostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory and our interests are in grave danger.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nWith confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph. So help us God.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nI ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7th, 1941, a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese Empire.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\r\nDecember 8, 1941",
