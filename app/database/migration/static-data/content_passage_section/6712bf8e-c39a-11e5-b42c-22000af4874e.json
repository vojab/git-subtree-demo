    "contents": "A researcher at an ethanol production company is interested in designing ways to produce ethanol more efficiently. She hypothesizes that alternative methods of milling will be more effective than the company\u2019s current milling methods. The researcher identifies five alternative methods to mill corn in preparation for ethanol production. She then uses each of the five new methods to mill batches of corn and prepare the corn starch for fermentation. She ferments the resulting sugars and measures the ethanol production over 60 hours of fermentation.\r\n",
