Based on a vision, Wovoka foretold that European expansion would end without violence and preached that Native Americans should live honest and peaceful lives of cross-cultural cooperation. The Ghost Dance religion became widespread among Native Americans. Because the religion taught that European rule in America would end and Native Americans would retake their land, the government and white settlers were antagonistic toward the new religion, and some Native Americans embraced a less peaceful, more violent version of the religion.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSitting Bull was a spiritual and political leader of the Hunkpapa Sioux (or Lacota) who was well known for defeating General Custer at Little Bighorn. Sitting Bull became interested in the Ghost Dance religion, and authorities, concerned that Sitting Bull would join the Ghost Dancers, arranged his arrest. Forty-three policemen came for Sitting Bull on December 15, 1890. They hauled him out of his cabin, but his followers were gathering outside. A gunfight ensued, and one of the policemen shot Sitting Bull dead. Six policemen and seven of Sitting Bull\u2019s followers were killed.<\/p>\r\n<p><i>The Ghost Dance Religion and Sitting Bull\u2019s Death<\/i>.<\/p>",
