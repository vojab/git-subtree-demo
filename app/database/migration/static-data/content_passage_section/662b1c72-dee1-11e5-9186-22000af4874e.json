Even as we end one war in Iraq, our military has been called upon to renew our focus on Afghanistan as part of a commitment to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat Al-Qa\u2019ida and its affiliates. This is part of a broad, multinational effort that is right and just, and we will be unwavering in our commitment to the security of our people, allies and partners. Moreover, as we face multiple threats\u2014from nations, nonstate actors, and failed states\u2014we will maintain the military superiority that has secured our country, and underpinned global security, for decades.",
