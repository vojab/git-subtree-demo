    "contents": "The African diaspora is the movement of African people and their descendants throughout the world. Most of the African diaspora was caused by slavery, which moved many Africans to the Western Hemisphere, affecting the population of the Americas today. Jamaica shows the impact of the African diaspora on modern populations. Between 1655 and 1838, Jamaica was a British colony, and the base of its economy was sugar plantations run by African slave labor. The amount of labor needed to run a large sugar plantation was high. By 1800, African slaves outnumbered European settlers by an estimated 300,000 to 30,000. Today, Jamaica\u2019s population is 90.9% black, reflecting this colonial demographic.",
