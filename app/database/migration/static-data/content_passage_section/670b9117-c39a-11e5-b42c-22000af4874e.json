    "contents": "Growing GM foods can potentially increase food production, thus making it possible to feed more people, especially in developing countries.  Improved food quality is another benefit associated with GM foods. A tomato, for example, can be genetically engineered to stay fresh longer. Another advantage is that GM crops can be engineered to withstand fluctuations in weather, thus assuring sufficient yields despite a poor growing season. Finally, GM crops could be engineered to include nutrients missing in a local diet.",
