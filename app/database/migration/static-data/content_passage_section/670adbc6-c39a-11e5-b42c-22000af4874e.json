    "contents": "The arguments against teaching cursive writing are simple. Few adults use cursive regularly or for important tasks. Handwritten notes can be printed. High schools and colleges expect students to type reports and essays. Businesses use keyboards for almost all communications, from emails to lengthy and complex reports. If cursive writing becomes obsolete, what is the cost to individuals or society? Perhaps it will become an archaic decorative art, similar to calligraphy, or a study for specialists, such as those who research historical documents. Since class time is limited, schools need to choose the most important subjects to teach, and cursive writing, which is fast becoming obsolete, is not among the most important subjects.",
