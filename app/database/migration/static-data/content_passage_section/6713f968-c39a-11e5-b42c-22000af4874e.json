Your mass marches and other forms of struggle have served as a constant source of strength to all political prisoners. \r\nI salute the African National Congress. It has fulfilled our every expectation in its role as leader of the great march to freedom. I salute our President, Comrade Oliver Tambo, for leading the ANC even under the most difficult circumstances. \r\nI salute the rank and file members of the ANC. You have sacrificed life and limb in the pursuit of the noble cause of our struggle.\r\nOn this occasion, we thank the world community for their great contribution to the anti-apartheid struggle. Without your support our struggle would not have reached this advanced stage. The sacrifice of the frontline states will be remembered by South Africans forever. \r\n",
