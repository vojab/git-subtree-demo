The watch had cost two hundred dollars originally, and I seemed to have paid out two or three thousand for repairs. While I waited and looked on I presently recognized in this watchmaker an old acquaintance \u2013 a steamboat engineer of other days, and not a good engineer, either. He examined all the parts carefully, just as the other watchmakers had done, and then delivered his verdict with the same confidence of manner.  He said, \"She makes too much steam \u2013 you want to hang the monkey-wrench on the safety-valve!\" I brained him on the spot, and had him buried at my own expense.\r\n",
