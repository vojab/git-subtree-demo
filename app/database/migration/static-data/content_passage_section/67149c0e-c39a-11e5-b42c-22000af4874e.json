    "contents": "Whirlyball is an unusual game played in only a few areas of the United States. It features two teams, each with five players, and is played on a court similar in size and shape to a basketball court. Also like basketball, there are goals set at each end of the court at a height of approximately ten feet. Unlike basketball, however, there is no horizontal basket through which players shoot the ball. Instead, the ball, which is plastic and about the size of a softball, must be thrown at a target in the center of the vertical backboard.\r\n",
