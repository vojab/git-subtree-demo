Without any evidence, Aristotle and other philosophers of the time rejected the idea. For two thousand years, the idea of atoms was not widely accepted. Around 1803, though, John Dalton used scientific data from chemical experiments with gasses to propose a theory of atoms. Although some parts of Dalton\u2019s theory have since been proven incorrect, his concepts form the basis of our modern knowledge of atoms.<\/p>",
