I hope you can experience the feelings that I felt then. I can recall that great battle clearly, and I remember the ones after that as well. Although it took much longer than I had initially anticipated, it was well worth it. It was difficult, and I became exhausted, but then we won and freed our country. We were a new nation. Now, each year on the fourth of July, I remember those days and smile. I hope you do, too.\r\n",
