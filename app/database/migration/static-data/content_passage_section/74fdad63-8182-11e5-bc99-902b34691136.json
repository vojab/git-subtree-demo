She was the daughter of James and Betsey, slaves of one Colonel Ardinburgh, Hurley, Ulster County, New York.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\u201cColonel Ardinburgh belonged to that class of people called Low Dutch. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\u201cOf her first master, she can give no account, as she must have been a mere infant when he died; and she, with her parents and some ten or twelve other fellow human chattels, became the legal property of his son, Charles Ardinburgh. She distinctly remembers hearing her father and mother say, that their lot was a fortunate one, as Master Charles was the best of the family,\u2014being, comparatively speaking, a kind master to his slaves.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>Sojourner Truth. <i>The Narrative of Sojourner Truth<\/i>. 1850.<\/p>",
