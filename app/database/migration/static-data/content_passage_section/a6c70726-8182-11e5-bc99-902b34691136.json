They are snowed in with four guests and a mysterious stranger, who has crashed his car in the snow. A detective arrives to warn the party of a potential murderer, and soon one of the guests is killed. The plot, a crucible that effectively traps together strangers in a circumstance of murder and suspicion, is above suspicion.<\/p>\r\n<p>What is highly suspect is the performance of Mark Karline as Giles Ralston, whose overdone acting was unbelievable. Jess Morgan performed as a lukewarm Mollie, and the chemistry between the two was non-existent. Major Metcalf is played by Storm Rocklander, who seems to distinctly enjoy making strange faces at the audience that ruin the effect of a play. Detective Sergeant Trotter, played by Karl Freiheim, gave a solid performance but struggled against the rest of the cast, outstanding only in its mediocrity. Director Amy Welsch could not pull together her cast to give this drama the performances it deserved.<\/p>\r\n<p>What should have been an enjoyable evening with a classic dinner mystery, the perfect complement to a candlelight meal, turned into a drawn-out, excruciating experience that I recommend avoiding.<\/p>\r\n<p><i>Review of The Mousetrap<\/i>.<\/p>",
