    "contents": "<p>Voltaire was a proponent of individual rights and freedoms, tolerance, and self-expression. Voltaire believed that people should be civically active, to improve their societies. As a philosopher during the French Enlightenment, Voltaire was one of the most influential figures in history. His values greatly influenced the development of the United States. Rousseau was also a French philosopher, but with very different beliefs. He believed that society corrupts humans, who are naturally good, and that solutions to human problems can be found by following nature. In many ways Voltaire and Rousseau were opposed, and the two men disliked each other. Because Voltaire was so influential in the formation of the U.S. government, it\u2019s likely that Rousseau\u2019s thought has no influence in the U.S. today.<\/p>",
