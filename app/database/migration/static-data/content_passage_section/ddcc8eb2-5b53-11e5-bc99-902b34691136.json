    "contents": "Most oceanic islands rise from the sea as a result of volcanic activity on the ocean floor. They do not have any links with the continents. Some oceanic islands are built up around one or two volcanic vents while others, like Tahiti, are formed by a whole series of vents. At first such islands are uninhabitable but gradually, as the lava cools, they begin to support life.\r\n",
