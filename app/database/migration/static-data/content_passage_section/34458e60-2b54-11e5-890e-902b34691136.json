At the center of the controversy is the cumulative effect of years of heading.<\/p>\r\n                                            <p>Although some of the research results are alarming, there has not to date been sufficient research done to warrant large-scale panic. In other words, no changes in soccer play are needed until or when research has confirmed that heading is indeed dangerous.<\/p>\r\n                                            <p>A soccer player heads the ball on an average of six times per month and many more times during soccer practice. This can add up to several thousand head impacts during the course of a career. A soccer ball can be propelled at speeds more than 74 miles per hour and can deliver enough force to fracture a cheekbone.<\/p>\r\n                                            <p>To research the possibility of brain injury, scientists at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, studied the brains of 31 amateur soccer players, all of whom had played soccer for an average of 22 years. Researchers used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that allows scientists to analyze microscopic changes in the brain\u2019s white matter. After the DTI was performed, participants were given a series of cognitive tests to measure memory and brain function.<\/p>\r\n                                            <p>Scientists did discover some changes in the brains of the players who had used heading most frequently. Furthermore, these same players often scored poorly on the cognitive tests.<\/p>\r\n                                            <p>However, most scientists in the field, caution that the results are preliminary. Others warn that the scope of the study was too limited to prove a clear link between heading and brain injuries.<\/p>\r\n                                            <p>Consequently, it is our hope that further research into the problem will be conducted. In the meantime, parents should continue to allow their children to play the sport, with the important caveat: be aware that too many headings may be dangerous.<\/p>\r\n                                            <p>[Sources for both passages:\r\n                                            <br \/>\r\n                                            http:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2013\/06\/130611082233.htm\r\n                                            <br \/>\r\n                                            http:\/\/www.headball.com\/hazards.html\r\n                                            <br \/>\r\n                                            http:\/\/news.discovery.com\/human\/health\/soccer-headers-brain-damage-sports-health-130611.htm\r\n                                            <br \/>\r\n                                            http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/health\/2013\/06\/11\/repetitive-soccer-ball-heading-could-lead-to-brain-injury\/\r\n                                            <br \/>\r\n                                            http:\/\/well.blogs.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/20\/new-worries-about-heading-the-soccer-ball\/?_r=0]<\/p>",
