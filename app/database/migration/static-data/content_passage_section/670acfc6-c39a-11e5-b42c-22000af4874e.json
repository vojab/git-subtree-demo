    "contents": "The benefits of gambling are obvious. Casinos add money to local economies and increase employment. According to a 1999 study by the University of Chicago\u2019s National Opinion Research Center, areas near casinos experienced 12% to 17% drops in welfare payments, unemployment rates, and unemployment insurance payments after casino gambling was introduced. Between 1990 and 2005, before Hurricane Katrina, employment grew 58% in the Biloxi-Gulfport area, a center of riverboat gambling, versus 20% throughout the state.",
