    "contents": "<p>Few native Scandinavians had an understanding of coins when the Viking Age began around 793 A.D. Only the weight of the silver or gold in a coin had value, and precious metal was used as tender in many forms. In other words, the Scandinavians had a bullion economy, which values the weight and the purity of metals, not the form of a coin. Scandinavians of the time often cut up larger metal objects into small chunks known as \u201chack-silver\u201d to make up the exact weight of silver for a monetary exchange. Traders carried small but accurate scales to measure metal and provide an exact system of exchange even without formal coinage.<\/p>",
