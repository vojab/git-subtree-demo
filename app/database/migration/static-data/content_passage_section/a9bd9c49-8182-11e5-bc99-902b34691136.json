Jeremy is from the South, and he has travelled north to Pittsburgh, where he is staying at Seth and Bertha\u2019s rooming house along with Bynum, another boarder.<\/i><\/p>\r\n<p>(Jeremy enters from the front door. About twenty-five, he gives the impression that he has the world in his hand, that he can meet life\u2019s challenges head on. He smiles a lot. He is a proficient guitar player, though his spirit has yet to be molded into song.)<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Bynum:<\/b> I hear Mr. Piney\u2019s boys had you.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Jeremy:<\/b> Fined me two dollars for nothing! Ain\u2019t done nothing.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Seth:<\/b> I told you when you come on here everybody know my house. Know these is respectable quarters. I don\u2019t put up with no foolishness. Everybody know Seth Holly keep a good house. Was my daddy\u2019s house. This house been a decent house for a long time.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Jeremy:<\/b> I ain\u2019t done nothing, Mr. Seth. I stopped by the Workmen\u2019s Club and got me a bottle. Me and Roper Lee from Alabama. Had us a half pint. We was fixing to cut that half in two when they came up on us. Asked us if we was working. We told them we was putting in the road over yonder and that it was our payday. Me and Roper Lee ain\u2019t even had a chance to take a drink when they grabbed us.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Seth:<\/b> I don\u2019t go for all that kind of carrying on.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Bertha:<\/b> Leave the boy alone, Seth. You know the police do that. Figure there\u2019s too many people out on the street they take some of them off. You know that.<\/p>\r\n<p>August Wilson. <i>From Joe Turner\u2019s Come and Gone<\/i>. 1988.<\/p>",
