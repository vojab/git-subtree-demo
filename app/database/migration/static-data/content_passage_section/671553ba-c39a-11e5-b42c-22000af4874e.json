    "contents": "As of 2010, an estimated 5.85 million U.S. citizens cannot vote because of a felony conviction.  This is a horrific number, greater than the total population of Wisconsin. Twelve states deny voting rights to felons after prison, parole, and probation are over: Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wyoming. The laws in these states need to be reformed.  No citizen should be denied voting rights after completing their prison sentence. It creates an unjust, permanent restriction.",
