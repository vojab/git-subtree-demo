    "contents": "The chemical reactions in the battery _____(2)_____ electrons to build up at the anode, or negative terminal. This creates an electrical charge. Because the anode and cathode become unbalanced (with more electrons at the anode than the cathode), extra electrons are pushed away from the anode. _____(3)_____ the electrolyte prevents electrons from moving through the battery. When no circuit is connected to the battery, the extra electrons have nowhere to go.",
