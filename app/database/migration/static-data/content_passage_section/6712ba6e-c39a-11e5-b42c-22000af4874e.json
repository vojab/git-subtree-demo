    "contents": "In fermentation, biological organisms such as yeast or bacteria convert sugar into acids, gases, or alcohol. Fermentation has many applications, including the production of beer and wine. One application of fermentation is the production of ethanol as fuel. Corn ethanol, for example, uses corn as a sugar source. The corn is milled, and then the corn starch is converted to simple sugars. Yeast is used to ferment the sugar. During fermentation, the sugar is converted into alcohol, which is refined and used for fuel.\r\n",
