We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without doing so, upon G.\u2019s saying that he had called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\u201cIf it is any point requiring reflection,\u201d observed Dupin\u2026, \u201cwe shall examine it to better purpose in the dark.\u201d<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\u201cThat is another of your odd notions,\u201d said the Prefect, who had a fashion of calling every thing \u201codd\u201d that was beyond his comprehension, and thus lived amid an absolute legion of \u201coddities.\u201d<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\u201cVery true,\u201d said Dupin, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe, and rolled towards him a comfortable chair.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\u201cAnd what is the difficulty now?\u201d I asked. \u2026<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\u201c\u2026The fact is, the business is very simple indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the details of it, because it is so excessively odd.\u201d<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\u201cSimple and odd,\u201d said Dupin.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\u201cWhy, yes; \u2026 we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles us altogether.\u201d<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\u201cPerhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault,\u201d said my friend.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\u201cWhat nonsense you do talk!\u201d replied the Prefect, laughing heartily.<\/p>",
