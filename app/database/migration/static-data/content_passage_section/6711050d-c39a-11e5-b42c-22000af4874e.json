    "contents": "<strong>(1)<\/strong> Mechanical waves are waves that travel through matter. <strong>(2)<\/strong> Waves in water and sound waves in air are two examples of mechanical waves. <strong>(3)<\/strong> Mechanical waves are caused by a disturbance or vibration in matter, whether solid, gas, liquid, or plasma. <strong>(4)<\/strong> Matter that waves are traveling through is called a medium. Water waves are formed by vibrations in a liquid and sound waves are formed by vibrations in a gas (air). <strong>(5)<\/strong> These mechanical waves travel through a medium by causing the molecules to bump into each other, like falling dominoes transferring energy from one to the next. <strong>(6)<\/strong> Sound waves cannot travel in the vacuum of space because there is no medium to transmit these mechanical waves.\r\n",
