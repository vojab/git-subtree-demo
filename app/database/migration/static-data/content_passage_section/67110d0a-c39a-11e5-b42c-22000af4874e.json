    "contents": "<strong>(1)<\/strong> Electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical waves in that they do not require a matter medium to propagate. <strong>(2)<\/strong> Electromagnetic waves, by traveling through electromagnetic fields, can travel not only through air and solid materials, but also through the vacuum of space. <strong>(3)<\/strong> In the 1860s and 1870s, a Scottish scientist named James Clerk Maxwell developed a scientific theory to explain electromagnetic waves. <strong>(4)<\/strong> He noticed that electrical fields and magnetic fields can couple together to form electromagnetic waves. <strong>(5)<\/strong> He summarized this relationship between electricity and magnetism into what are now referred to as \"Maxwell's Equations.\"",
