    "contents": "Theoretical physicists use mathematics to explain and predict physical phenomena, while experimental physicists use experimental data and observation of nature to support or refute theoretical ideas. In 1927, Georges Lema\u00eetre proposed, based on mathematical equations, what has come to be called the Big Bang. In 1929, Edwin Hubble discovered through observation that the red-shift seen in light from other galaxies supported Lema\u00eetre\u2019s theory.",
