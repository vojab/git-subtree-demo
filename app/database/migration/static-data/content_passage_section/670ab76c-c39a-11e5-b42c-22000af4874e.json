Every few minutes, one student would run to another group and quickly run back. The last cloud _____(3)_____, and the students looked around themselves. The view spread in front of them, a picnic blanket landscape: a brilliant patchwork of greens and yellows. The hum of student activity rose until the mountaintop was almost _____(4)_____. Then there was a sudden \u201cFwhoop!\u201d as a glider slid into the air. Another opened, then a third; red, orange, and pink, they circled the students. Applause rang out as the three gliders circled overhead then drifted back down, following the swirl of the road around the mountain. The students celebrated their success. As design teams, they had successfully launched their first hang gliders. \r\n",
