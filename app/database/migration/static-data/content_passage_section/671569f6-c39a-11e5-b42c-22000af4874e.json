    "contents": "A gold standard means that a government calculates the value of paper money based on its worth in gold. The government might set a price for gold of $50 an ounce. Buying and selling gold at an established cost sets a gold equivalency for the dollar: 1\/50 of an ounce of gold. The United States was on a gold standard up until 1933, when the government created a gold reserve for international purposes only. In 1971, the gold standard was eliminated entirely. Today, the U.S. dollar is a fiat currency, given value by the \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d of the U.S. government.",
