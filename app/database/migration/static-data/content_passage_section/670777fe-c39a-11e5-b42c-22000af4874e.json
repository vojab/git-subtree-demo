Kennedy, June 15, 1963<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT<\/p>\r\n<p>THE WHITE HOUSE<\/p>\r\n<p>IT MIGHT SEEM FANTASTIC TO IMAGINE THAT EVEN IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI ANYONE WOULD SEEK TO DO INJURY TO A NON-VIOLENT LEADER LIKE DR MARTIN KING AS HE GOES THERE THIS MORNING ON A MISSION OF SORROW. YET IT WAS FANTASTIC BUT TRUE THAT SOME DEPRAVED ASSASSIN GUNNED DOWN ANOTHER MAN OF NON-VIOLENCE THE LATE MEDGAR EVERS WHOSE FUNERAL DR KING AND HIS ASSOCIATES WILL BE ATTENDING TODAY IN JACKSON. SHOULD HARM COME TO DR KING TO ADD TO THE MISERY WHICH DECENT AMERICANS OF BOTH RACES EXPERIENCED WITH THE MURDER OF MR EVERS THE RESTRAINT OF MANY PEOPLE ALL OVER THE NATION MIGHT BURST ITS BONDS AND BRING ABOUT A BRUTAL BLOODY HOLOCAUST THE LIKE OF WHICH THIS COUNTRY HAS NOT SEEN. I THEREFORE IMPLORE YOU IN THE SPIRIT OF YOU RECENT MAGNIFICENT APPEAL FOR JUSTICE TO UTILIZE EVERY FEDERAL FACILITY TO PROTECT A MAN SORELY NEEDED FOR THE ERA. FOR TO MILLIONS MARTIN KING SYMBOLIZES THE BEARING FORWARD OF THE TORCH OF FREEDOM SO SAVAGELY WRESTED FROM THE DYING GRIP OF MEDGAR EVERS. AMERICA NEEDS AND THE WORLD CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE HIM TO THE WHIMS OF MURDEROUS MANIACS.<\/p>\r\n<p>JACKIE ROBINSON<\/p>\r\n<p>http:\/\/www.archives.gov\/education\/lessons\/jackie-robinson\/telegram-1963.html<\/p>",
