    "contents": "<b>Frederick Douglass was born into slavery in Maryland in 1818. He secretly taught himself to read and write, and in 1838 he escaped to the North where he eventually became a leading abolitionist. The following passage is from his memoir, <i>Life of an American Slave<\/i>, published in 1845. Douglass is describing one of his slave master.<\/b>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n\u201cHe would at times seem to take great pleasure in whipping a slave. I have often been awakened at the dawn of day by the most heart-rending shrieks of an own aunt of mine, whom he used to tie up to a joist, and whip upon her naked back till she was literally covered with blood. No words, no tears, no prayers, from his gory victim, seemed to move his iron heart from its bloody purpose. The louder she screamed, the harder he whipped. . .\u201d",
