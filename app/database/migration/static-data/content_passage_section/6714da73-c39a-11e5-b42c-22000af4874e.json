    "contents": "Betsy Ross made her living as a seamstress, and had many customers. She sewed many things, including clothes, blankets, and curtains. Each day, she would start with a pile of cloth and create things people paid her to make for them. Everyone knew she would do a wonderful job, so they came to her home and asked her to make many items for them. Business was so good, and as she began to get very busy, Betsy hired me to help. I am an experienced seamstress, so I can sew very well. \r\n",
