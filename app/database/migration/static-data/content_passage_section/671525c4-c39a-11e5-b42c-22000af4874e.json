    "contents": "The falls contribute a large amount of hydroelectric power to the power grid in the Eastern US and Canada. In fact, there's a statue of Nikola Tesla at the falls, who was the first to successfully turn the energy of falling water from Niagara Falls into electricity that was distributed for private and industrial use. Though hydroelectricity has been controversial in terms of the environment (and especially a bane for waterfalling), there's no denying the critical role it has played in allowing certain cities (and even whole economies) to be built up and thrive. The human intervention has also meant the flow of the Niagara River is regulated in a way that actually slows down the rate of erosion of the falls and keeps the flow constant nearly year round (except for the coldest of winters when the river and falls are frozen over).\r\n",
