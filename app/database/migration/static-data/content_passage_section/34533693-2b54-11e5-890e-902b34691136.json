Even if the player is wearing a helmet, the danger of concussion or brain damage is just too great to warrant the risk.<\/p>\r\n                                            <p>My friend, Janet, who is an avid soccer player, collided with another player and as a result suffered a concussion. That\u2019s enough proof for me that soccer is a dangerous sport.<\/p>\r\n                                            <p>During the past decade concerns have been raised about the concussions and mild traumatic brain injury sustained by football players and military personnel, as more and more studies suggest that the cumulative effect of these injuries may have a lasting impact on cognition and memory.<\/p>\r\n                                            <p>Consequently, scientists turned their attention to soccer, in particular the practice of heading. What scientists discovered was that although soccer heading does not result in concussions, the cumulative results of continual heading can be long-term brain damage.<\/p>\r\n                                            <p>All parents should take these recent findings as a wake-up call. If there is the slightest, the remotest chance that soccer could harm players' brains, why play the game? Parents who allow their children to play soccer are either ignorant or appallingly indifferent to the health of their children.<\/p>\r\n                                            <p>We cannot condone schools' sponsorship of such a dangerous sport. We all must do everything we can to keep our children safe.<\/p>",
