The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says there is 95 percent certainty that humans have caused most of the warming of the planet's surface that has occurred since the 1950s \u2014 up from 90 percent certainty in the last assessment report, which came out in 2007.<\/p>\r\n<p>The report draws from many independent scientific analyses of climate change, which use direct observations of Earth\u2019s climate, paleoclimate archives, theoretical studies of climate processes and simulations using climate models.<p>\r\n<p>Other key findings include:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>- Today carbon dioxide is at an \"unprecedented\" level not seen for at least the last 800,000 years.<\/li>\r\n    <li>- Sea level is set to continue to rise at a faster rate than over the past 40 years. Waters are expected to rise by between 26 cm (10 inches) at the low end and 82 cm (30 inches) at the high end.<\/li>\r\n    <li>- There is \"high confidence\" that over the last two decades the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been melting, glaciers have receded in most parts of the world, and Arctic sea ice has continued to shrink in terms of extent.<\/li>\r\n    <li>- Many of the changes seen in our climate since the 1950s are \"unprecedented over decades to millennia.\"<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>\r\n    <a href=\"http:\/\/climate.nasa.gov\/bews\/988\">http:\/\/climate.nasa.gov\/bews\/988<\/a>\r\n<\/p>",
