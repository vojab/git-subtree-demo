    "contents": "In the western United States, wildfires have covered larger areas of forests in recent years. Fires covering hundreds of thousands of acres occur with increasing frequency. Increasing fires mean increased costs of firefighting, damage to homes, and damage to forested areas. Some of the damage to natural resources is irreversible.\r\n\r\nTwo main potential causes of increased fire activity are the way land has been used over the years, and changes in climate. The solution to increased fire activity will depend on its causes. If land-use history is the main cause of increased fires, then revitalizing land and using land in new ways may hold the key to reducing wildfires. On the other hand, if climate change is the cause of increased fires, these efforts may not yield results, and the root cause of climate change will need to be addressed.\r\n",
