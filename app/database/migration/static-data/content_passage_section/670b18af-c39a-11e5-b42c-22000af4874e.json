Of those, 143 of the victims were children younger than age 5.<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>The latest media-reported figures are consistent with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission\u2019s (CPSC) annual Submersion Report, and show that young children and toddlers are especially vulnerable to drowning. Drowning is the leading cause of unintentional death among children 1 to 4 years of age and it is the second leading cause of death for children from 5 to 14 years old.<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cThe time is now to turn the tide on child drownings,\u201d said CPSC Chairman Inez Tenenbaum. \u201cIn warm weather states and indoor swim parks, pools are still open. Let\u2019s work together to prevent drownings by putting up barriers and having eyes-on supervision of children in and around the water.\u201d<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>CPSC\u2019s national Pool Safely campaign reinforces important safety steps: fence all pools, stay close to children in the water, be alert, and teach children how to swim...<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>The Pool Safely campaign was launched in 2010 to raise awareness about pool and spa safety, as mandated by the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act. The campaign has increased its focus on populations most at risk of drowning. African American children between the ages of 5 and 19 are six times more likely to drown in pools than white and Hispanic children that age, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>Data from USA Swimming indicate that 70 percent of African American children, 60 percent of Hispanic children, and 40 percent of white children cannot swim. Children who cannot swim are more likely to drown.<\/p>\r\n \r\n <img src=\"\/content-assets\/reading-test-1\/child_drownings.png\" alt=\"Child drownings statistics\" height=\"607\" width=\"450\">",
