    "contents": "Gloria, an amateur researcher, is concerned that a local pond has become polluted. In just over a year Gloria has observed that the pond has become increasingly slimy, weed infested, and smelly. The pond is no longer suitable for swimming or fishing. Gloria\u2019s hypothesis is that fertilizer pollution has caused the pond to enter a state of eutrophication, resulting in so much algae growth that there isn\u2019t enough oxygen left for other species. To test this hypothesis, Gloria took water samples from the pond over the course of several weeks.",
