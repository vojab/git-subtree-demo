Lyndon Johnson, President from 1963-1969, delivered the following message to Congress to encourage new laws that would provide assistance to needy families and help them escape poverty. <\/b>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nAnnual Message to the Congress on the State of the Union, January 8, 1964.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nThis administration today, here and now, declares unconditional war on poverty in America. I urge this Congress and all Americans to join with me in that effort.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nIt will not be a short or easy struggle, no single weapon or strategy will suffice, but we shall not rest until that war is won. The richest Nation on earth can afford to win it. We cannot afford to lose it. One thousand dollars invested in salvaging an unemployable youth today can return $40,000 or more in his lifetime.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nPoverty is a national problem, requiring improved national organization and support. But this attack, to be effective, must also be organized at the State and the local level and must be supported and directed by State and local efforts.\r\n<p><\/p>\r\nFrom: Lyndon B. Johnson: \"Annual Message to the Congress on the State of the Union.,\" January 8, 1964. Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, <i>The American Presidency Project<\/i>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.presidency.ucsb.edu\/ws\/?pid=26787.\r\n",
