Research has provided overwhelming evidence supporting the benefits of early exposure to the arts. Thanks to the works of researchers like T.N. Malyarenko, it has been shown that listening to music for just an hour a day improves the chemistry of the brain. For example, watching the brain scan of a child tracing letters of the alphabet may show activity in a small part of the brain, but have the child put the pencil down and sing the alphabet song while clapping the rhythm along with the class, and their brain will light up like a circuit board.",
