    "contents": "We put out to sea at sunrise on the morning of the 21st, and arrived the same evening, by mistake, assisted with a stiffish easterly breeze, at a small place called Rakodah, which, contained a small fort, three mat huts, and many burnt ones. It was noted that the place had been occupied for a long period by a people called Rheer Dud.  The Musa Abok, a subtribe of the Habr Teljala, were the former and rightful owners of the place, but they suddenly returned and took the usurpers by surprise.  They drove them off by setting fire to the village. The next day, by hard work, tacking up the wind, which still continued easterly, we succeeded in reaching Bunder H\u00e9is, which was occupied by the Musa Abokr.  We were detained here by adverse winds for two days, during which time I went on shore and paid my respects to the Akil (chief) of the place, who lived in a small box-shaped stone fort.  It was composed of square mat huts, all built together, and occupied only by a few women, who made mats.  The Akil's reception was very warm and polite. He offered me everything at his disposal, and gave as an honorary present a Dumba sheep and a bowl of sour camel's milk, which I thought at the time the most delicious thing I ever drank. It is sharp and rough, like labourers' cider, and, drunk in the heat of the day, is most refreshing. When first taken, and until the stomach becomes accustomed to it, it operates like medicine. The fish we caught were not very good, but comical in appearance, and of a great variety of the most beautiful prismatic colors, changing in tint as different lights and shades struck upon them.",
