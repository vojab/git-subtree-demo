The story takes place after a nuclear war has turned the world into a wasteland.<\/b><\/p><p>The boy fell in beside him. Hendricks strode along. The boy walked silently, clutching his teddy bear.<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Hendricks said, after a time.<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cDavid Edward Derring.\u201d<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cDavid?

They went away.\u201d<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been alone since?\u201d<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cYes.\u201d<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>Hendricks glanced down. The boy was strange, saying very little. Withdrawn. But that was the way they were, the children who had survived. Quiet. Stoic. A strange kind of fatalism gripped them. Nothing came as a surprise. They accepted anything that came along. There was no longer any normal, any natural course of things, moral or physical, for them to expect. Custom, habit, all the determining forces of learning were gone; only brute experience remained.<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cAm I walking too fast?\u201d Hendricks said.<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cNo.\u201d<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cHow did you happen to see me?\u201d<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cI was waiting.\u201d<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cWaiting?\u201d Hendricks was puzzled. \u201cWhat were you waiting for?\u201d<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cTo catch things.\u201d<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cWhat kind of things?\u201d<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cThings to eat.\u201d<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Hendricks set his lips grimly. A thirteen year old boy, living on rats and gophers and half-rotten canned food. Down in a hole under the ruins of a town. With radiation pools and claws, and Russian dive-mines up above, coasting around in the sky.<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d David asked.<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cTo the Russian lines.\u201d<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cRussian?\u201d<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cThe enemy. The people who started the war. They dropped the first radiation bombs. They began all this.\u201d<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>The boy nodded. His face showed no expression.<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>\u201cI\u2019m an American,\u201d Hendricks said.<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>There was no comment. On they went, the two of them, Hendricks walking a little ahead, David trailing behind him, hugging his dirty teddy bear against his chest.<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>About four in the afternoon they stopped to eat. Hendricks built a fire in a hollow between some slabs of concrete. He cleared the weeds away and heaped up bits of wood. The Russians\u2019 lines were not very far ahead. Around him was what had once been a long valley, acres of fruit trees and grapes. Nothing remained now but a few bleak stumps and the mountains that stretched across the horizon at the far end. And the clouds of rolling ash that blew and drifted with the wind, settling over the weeds and remains of buildings, walls here and there, once in a while what had been a road.<\/p>\r\n                                             <p>http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/32032\/32032-h\/32032-h.htm<\/p>",
