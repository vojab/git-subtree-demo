    "contents": "Several visible features are common to most glaciers. At locations where a glacier flows rapidly, friction creates giant cracks called crevasse, which may make travel across a glacier treacherous. Other common glacial features are moraine, created when the glacier pushes or carries rocky debris as it moves. These long, dark bands of debris are visible on top and along the edges of glaciers. Medial moraines run down the middle of a glacier, lateral moraines along the sides, and terminal moraines are found at the terminus, or snout, of a glacier. Sometimes one glacier flows into another, creating combined wider moraines. Often these linear deposits of rocks are left behind, almost intact, after the ice in a glacier has melted away. Studying these rocky debris remnants, and the sediments that were once beneath the glacier, is the subject of glacial geology and geomorphology.\r\n",
