These treaties limited Native American lands to reservations and made it possible for European Americans to settle in the Northwest. The reservation system did not only limit Native Americans to specific areas of land but also tried to encourage Native Americans to change their culture and adopt elements of European culture, such as religion and farming. The European Americans who settled in the area brought with them different ways of treating the land and natural resources, and were part of the expansion of the United States from east to west across the North American continent.<\/p>",
