    "contents": "<p>Before the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the Soviet government ignored warnings about the German buildup of troops, and Germany initially overwhelmed the Soviet armies, forcing the surrender of millions of Soviet troops. The German army advanced, reaching Leningrad by September 1941. German troops approached Moscow in early December. The troops, though, were not equipped for the winter and had advanced beyond their supply lines, which were vulnerable due to 1,000-mile distance between Moscow and Berlin. The Soviet Union launched a major counterattack, pushing the German forces back from Moscow. After several weeks, the Germans were able to establish a new front east of Smolensk.<\/p>",
