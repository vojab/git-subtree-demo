Arizona rose out of the legal aid movement, which advocated providing legal assistance to impoverished suspected criminals. Ernesto Miranda was convicted of rape, kidnapping, and robbery, with no other evidence than a confession he gave during police interrogation. Lawyers argued that Miranda was not provided due process and protected against self-incrimination. In 1966, the Supreme Court decided the case, holding that criminal suspects must be informed of their right to consult with an attorney and of their right against self-incrimination prior to questioning by the police. These rights came to be known as \u201cMiranda rights.\u201d<\/p>",
