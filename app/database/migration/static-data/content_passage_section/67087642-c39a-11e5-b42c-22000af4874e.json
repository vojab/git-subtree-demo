Luckily, no one was hurt. There was one person working in the office, and she managed to call the police and remain undetected by the police. The thief stole money from the safe, as well as laptops and the iPads. He or she escaped before the police could respond and has not yet been identified or arrested. Until we can conform that the building is secure, you MUST not be in the building after 8:00 p.m.",
