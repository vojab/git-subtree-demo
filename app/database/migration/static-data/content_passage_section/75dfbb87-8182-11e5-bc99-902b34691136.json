All these sites showed damage from fire around the 7th or 8th century. Early archaeologists concluded that the whole city was ravaged and burned by invaders, possibly the Toltecs. However, this conclusion has since become controversial. A modern alternative theory holds that the burning was from an internal uprising of the lower class.<\/p>",
