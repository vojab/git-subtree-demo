BURKE:<\/b> Why do you think the United States government held so many Japanese-Americans in internment camps during World War II?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>MAGGIE:<\/b> Well, it was national security. It\u2019s important to be safe.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>JOE:<\/b> I don\u2019t think so. It was just prejudice. They weren\u2019t confined for any other reason than their race. That\u2019s racist.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>PAUL:<\/b> It\u2019s racial profiling, just like a DWB\u2014you know, driving while black. The police stop you just because you\u2019re black, because they think you\u2019re more likely to have drugs or guns. It\u2019s the same thing.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<b>MAGGIE:<\/b> Well, the truth is that young black men are more likely to have drugs or guns, and the Japanese did bomb Pearl Harbor. Those Japanese-Americans were more likely to have sympathy with their own country. After all, there wasn\u2019t another Japanese surprise attack, was there? It must have worked.<\/p>",
