(6) In addition, low-wavelength, non-visible infrared radiation can carry heat directly from warm objects to cooler objects. (7) Infrared radiation is why you can feel the heat of a hot burner element on a stovetop, even from across the room. (8) Older windows will allow infrared radiation coming from warm objects outside to radiate into your home; shades can help to block this radiation. (9) Newer windows have low-e coatings that block infrared radiation. Infrared radiation will also carry the heat of your walls and ceiling directly to your body.\r\n",
