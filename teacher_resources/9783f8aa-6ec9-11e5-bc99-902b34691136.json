    "description": "The TASC Test Curriculum Blueprint bridges the gap between standards and skills on the Test Assessing Secondary Completion\u2122 (TASC). Test standards provide a useful description of what students must learn to do, but identifying the discrete skills and content that constitute these standards is essential for teaching students how to get there. The TASC Test Curriculum Blueprint distills the standards for each TASC subject into specific, bite-sized skills that all teachers can use to prepare their students. These essential instructional skills are useful in designing lessons and assessing students' progress toward more complex standards.",
