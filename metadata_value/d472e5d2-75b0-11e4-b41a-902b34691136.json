    "description": "Use the equation of a linear model to solve problems in the context of bivariate measurement data, interpreting the slope and intercept. For example, in a linear model for a biology experiment, interpret a slope of 1.5 cm\/hr as meaning that an additional hour of sunlight each day is associated with an additional 1.5 cm in mature plant height.",
