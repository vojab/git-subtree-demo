    "description": "Understand that integers can be divided, provided that the divisor is not zero, and every quotient of integers (with non-zero divisor) is a rational number. If p and q are integers, then -(p\/q) = (-p)\/q = p\/(-q). Interpret quotients of rational numbers by describing real-world contexts.",
