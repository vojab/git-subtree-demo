Once a solution has reached the limit of the solute\u2019s and solvent\u2019s solubility, the solution is said to be saturated. For example, when salt is gradually added to water, stirring constantly, the salt will dissolve in the water until saturation is reached.<\/p> \r\n<p><b>What will happen if more salt is added past the point of saturation?<\/b><\/p>",
