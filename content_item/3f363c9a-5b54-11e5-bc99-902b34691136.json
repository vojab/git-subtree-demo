Anthony says, \"It was we, the people; not we, the white male citizens; nor yet we, the male citizens; but we, the whole people, who formed the Union.\" She stresses that the wording of the Constitution includes all people. The passage also states that the inequality of the law \"ordains all men sovereigns, all women subjects, carries dissension, discord and rebellion into every home of the nation.\" She is also arguing that the current law is unjust to women and causes dissent.",
