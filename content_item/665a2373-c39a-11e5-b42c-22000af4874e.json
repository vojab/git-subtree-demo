It shouldn\u2019t appear to modify \u201cbowl of cereal\u201d or \u201ctable.\u201d The choice that includes \u201cI wait for my dad to appear with my bowl of cereal\u201d is incorrect, since it sounds like the dad will be carrying a bowl of cereal. That\u2019s not the same meaning. The choice \u201cI sit at the table with my bowl of cereal, and I\u2019m barely able to keep still, and I wait for my dad to appear\u201d is a run-on sentence with three main clauses.",
