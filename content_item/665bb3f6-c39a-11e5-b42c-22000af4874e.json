    "feedback": "The correct answer is: \u201cMy sales manager and I would like to meet with you to discuss the available options.\u201d This question asks you to pick the correct pronoun to use. When you use a pronoun in a group or series with other nouns, sometimes it\u2019s difficult to tell which pronoun is correct. An easy way to tell is to remove the extra words and just use the pronoun in the sentence. \u201cI would like to meet with you\u201d sounds correct. \u201cMe would like to meet with you\u201d clearly sounds incorrect. That\u2019s because the pronoun is the subject of the sentence, and it needs to be in the subjective case. \u201cMe\u201d is in the objective case, and \u201cI\u201d is in the subjective case. The correct subject is \u201cMy sales manager and I.\u201d\r\n",
