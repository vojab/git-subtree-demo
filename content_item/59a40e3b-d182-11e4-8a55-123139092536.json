The first part of the sentence describes the wide range of groups that are equally affected by ASD. The second part mentions that ASD is unevenly distributed by gender; men are more likely to have ASD than women. These two ideas contrast each other. The words \u201caccordingly,\u201d \u201cotherwise,\u201d and \u201csubsequently\u201d don\u2019t connect the ideas clearly. The word \u201chowever\u201d shows contrast and is the correct choice.",
