Each average speed can be shown as a bar, and it will be easy to see which is fastest. A pie chart would be a better choice to show the percentage of movies that are dramas, comedies, or other genres. To show changes in temperature over a half hour or changes in the volume of calls over a day, a line graph would be more effective. A line graph is a good way to show change over time.\r\n",
