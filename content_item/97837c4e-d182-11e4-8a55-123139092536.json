Your city has just implemented an improved curbside recycling program that allows more items to be recycled, including glass, plastic, paper, and cardboard. Your community is dedicating this month\u2019s newsletter to the new recycling program.<\/p>\r\n<p>Write an essay for your community newsletter in which you argue that every resident should begin recycling one new type of recyclable waste. Think carefully about what reasons will convince your neighbors to recycle.<\/p>",
