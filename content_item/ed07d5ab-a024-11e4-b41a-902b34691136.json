    "description": "Extremophiles are organisms that live and thrive in extreme environments, such as extreme heat, cold, or environments toxic to most other forms of life. The Berkeley Pit in Butte, Montana contains waste products from years of copper mining. It is arguably the most toxic body of water in the United States. Scientists hypothesize that extremophiles who thrive on consuming such waste can be used to break down the toxic compounds into harmless chemicals.",
