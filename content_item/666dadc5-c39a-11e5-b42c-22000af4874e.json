    "feedback": "The most useful organization is based on the event or trip when the photos were taken. If the photos are organized by year, then there may be many events in one year. It would be difficult to find a specific photo. If the photos are organized by day, it might similarly be difficult to find photos you want. Will you remember the specific day of an event? Or would it be easier to recognize the group \u201cJosh\u2019s Wedding\u201d? Organizing the photos by color scheme is probably not very useful. You\u2019re unlikely to look for a personal photo by color. You\u2019re more likely to look for a photo of \u201cSofia\u2019s Graduation\u201d than \u201cGreen and Blue.\u201d",
