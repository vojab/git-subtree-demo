The first two lines describe when the narrator was angry with a friend, and the second two lines describe when the narrator was angry with a foe, or enemy. The second and fourth lines describe the results of the two different situations. Anger toward a friend is discussed and forgotten, while anger toward an enemy is kept inside and grows. The repetition creates a comparison of the results of his anger in two situations.<\/p>\r\n<br\/>\r\nI was angry with my friend.<br \/>\r\n<b>I told my wrath, my wrath did end.<\/b><br \/>\r\nI was angry with my foe.<br \/>\r\n<b>I told it not, my wrath did grow;<\/b>",
