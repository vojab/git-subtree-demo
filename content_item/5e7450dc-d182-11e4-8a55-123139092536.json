    "feedback": "The correct answer is \"leaks through.\" The sentence should read: \u201cVolcanoes form when magma, molten and semi-molten rock beneath the Earth\u2019s surface, rises and leaks through a rupture in the crust.\u201d This question asks you to choose the correct commonly confused words. The word \u201cleak\u201d means to accidentally or unusually go through or out of a container. The word \u201cleek\u201d is a kind of vegetable.
