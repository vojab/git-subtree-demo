The density of the rocks might affect the ability of the tide to wash those rocks higher up on the shoreline, so this information would be relevant to answering the question. If the scientist finds that the rocks most common at low tide are denser, he might conclude that the density of the rock makes it difficult for the tide to wash those rocks higher up on the shoreline.\r\n",
