As the warmed air rises around you, cooler air moves in to take its place and absorb more of your warmth. The faster this convecting air moves, the cooler you feel.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Radiation occurs when heat radiates across the space between you and the objects in your vicinity. If objects are warmer than you are, heat will travel toward you. Removing heat through ventilation reduces the temperature of the ceiling, walls, and furnishings. The cooler your surroundings, the more you will radiate heat to the objects, rather than the other way around.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>source: http:\/\/energy.gov\/energysaver\/articles\/principles-heating-and-cooling<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best selections therefore are:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Convection cools the person by heating nearby air and causing it to rise.
