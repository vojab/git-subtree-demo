The farther east the mean center of population is, the higher the population in the east is compared to the population in the west. The map shows a consistent movement of the population towards the west and towards the south over time.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\nIf the mean center of population in 2050 were in Kentucky, the population would still be, generally, moving toward the south, but there would be a higher concentration of population in the east than in 2000. This could be explained if the population in the east increased faster than the population in the west.<img src='\/uploads\/assessments\/3309\/3idgoqyy3329.png' alt='Answer Explanation Image'>",
