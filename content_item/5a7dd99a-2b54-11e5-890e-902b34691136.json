    "feedback": "The passage argues that, since carbon dioxide contributes to global warming, it is important to understand where and when carbon is released into the atmosphere. Although the passage does state that human activity is a primary source of carbon dioxide and that human activity is creating carbon dioxide faster than the planet can remove it, the focus of the text is on finding and tracking sources of carbon dioxide.",
