Since blue eyes is a recessive trait, the child would need two recessive blue-eyed alleles to inherit blue eyes. This kind of pairing comprises half of the possibilities on the diagram; this means there is a 50% chance that the child will have blue eyes.<img src='\/uploads\/assessments\/2999\/6szlccnf3011.png' alt='Answer Explanation Image'>",
