    "prompt": "The concept of natural selection was first developed by Charles Darwin in the 1800s and presented in his book <i>The Origin of Species<\/i> in 1859. When a newly proposed explanation of natural phenomena is presented to the scientific community, it is tested, as a hypothesis, by other scientists. Scientists predict the expected results from scientific data if the hypothesis is accurate, and they gather scientific data to support or refute it. If a large quantity of scientific data continues to support the hypothesis, the hypothesis becomes accepted as a scientific theory. Which of the following best describes the role of Sir Cyril Clarke\u2019s work with moths in relation to the theory of natural selection?\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSir Cyril Clarke\u2019s work provides",

    "feedback": "<p><strong > <\/strong>Sir Cyril Clarke documented that lighter moth varieties are the most common today in industrial England. Based on natural selection, when the tree trunks became lighter after air pollutants were reduced and lichen grew back, the moths should become lighter. Sir Cyril Clarke documented that moths are lighter by doing field studies\u2014that is, gathering scientific data. His results were as expected and support natural selection.<\/p>\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\nSince the 1950s, the amount of heavy particulate air pollutants reaching the trees has lessened, and lichen has grown back. Now, <b>lighter moth varieties are the most common, as documented by Sir Cyril Clarke<\/b> from the University of Liverpool in field studies between 1959 and 1995.",
