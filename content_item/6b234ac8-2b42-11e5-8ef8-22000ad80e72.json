The word \u201cwhen\u201d shows that this clause can\u2019t stand alone as a sentence. Using a period or a semicolon is incorrect. The dependent clause is a fragment. A comma after \u201celectrons\u201d is also incorrect. \u201cElectrons\u201d is the subject of the independent clause, and there should not be a comma between the subject and verb. There should be a comma after \u201ccathode\u201d to separate the dependent clause from the independent clause.",
