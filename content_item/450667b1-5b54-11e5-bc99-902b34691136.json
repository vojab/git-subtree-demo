The two sentences describe two separate things that the speaker did: walked to the store and bought some milk. The conjunction \u201cfor\u201d is not correct because it shows cause and effect. The conjunction \u201cor\u201d shows a choice, so it is also incorrect. The conjunction \u201cso\u201d also shows cause and effect, so it\u2019s not appropriate. The best choice is \u201cand,\u201d which simply shows that two things happened.",
