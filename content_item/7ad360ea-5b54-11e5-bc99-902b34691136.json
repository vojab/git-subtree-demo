Because it is at the beginning of the sentence, use a comma to show where the main clause begins.<\/p>\r\n<p>The choice \u201cDanny entered the museum noticed the massive sculpture in the center of the room\u201d is missing the word \u201cand\u201d between \u201cmuseum\u201d and \u201cnoticed.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>The choice \u201cUpon entering the room the massive sculpture was in the center of the room\u201d implies that the sculpture entered the room! In this choice, \u201cupon entering the room\u201d is a dangling modifier.<\/p>\r\n<p>The choice \u201cDanny noticed the massive sculpture in the center, of the room upon entering the museum\u201d has an unnecessary comma after the word \u201ccenter.\u201d No comma is needed before a prepositional phrase after the verb.<\/p>",
