The energy that does reach the earth\u2019s surface, however, is enough to sustain the earth\u2019s living organisms. The process through which the sun's light is converted into life-sustaining food is called photosynthesis.<\/span> \r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>In photosynthesis, what is combined with energy from the sun to produce oxygen gas and glucose?<\/b> Click the answer below and drag it to complete the equation at the right.
