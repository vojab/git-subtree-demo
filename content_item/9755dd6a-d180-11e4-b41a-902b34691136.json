    "prompt": "<center><p><b>Turning on a Lamp<\/b><\/p><\/center>\r\n\r\n<p>An electric circuit is a closed pathway for the flow of electrical current. Circuits have a switch used to start and stop the flow of current, and a wire conductor used to carry the current. Rubber, an insulator, coats the wire so that current isn't carried away from the circuit. Powered by the current is one or more resistors that the electricity cannot pass through easily. A resistor is something that resists the flow of electricity and gives off heat. Every circuit also has a power source such as a battery (direct current) or a wall outlet (alternating current). A typical house lamp is considered a circuit.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Based on the description of a circuit, which of the following is true?<\/b><\/p>",
