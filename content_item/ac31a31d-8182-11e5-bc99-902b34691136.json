    "description": "Click the <u>one best answer<\/u> to each question.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\nOver the course of the play, Torvald learns that Nora has forged a bond and borrowed money to bring Torvald to Italy to save his health. He is horrified at the revelation and condemns her, but when he learns the lender has forgiven Nora and will not reveal her crime, he also forgives Nora. However, Nora will not take his forgiveness. Torvald\u2019s reaction to learning of her crime has destroyed the marriage for Nora. Near the end of the play, Torvald tells Nora, \u201cLet me help you if you are in want.\u201d Nora responds, \u201cNo. I can receive nothing from a stranger.\u201d",

In the beginning of the play, Nora is affectionate toward Torvald, and she is horrified by the idea of his death. She says, \u201c Oh! don\u2019t say such horrid things.\u201d When Torvald offers Nora money to please her, Nora\u2019s reaction is pleased: \u201cMoney! \u201d In the end of the play, however, when Torvald offers her help, she rejects him immediately, calling him a stranger. Her perception of Torvald has changed, and so her reaction to Torvald has changed. Nora has moved from being affectionate toward Torvald to feeling as if she doesn\u2019t really know him.<\/p>\r\n<br\/>\r\n\u201cNo. I can receive nothing from a <b>stranger.<\/b>\u201d",
