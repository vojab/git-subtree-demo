When the poem states, \u201cIn me she had drowned a young girl,\u201d it means that the face of the young girl has disappeared into the mirror. The woman is no longer young. As the woman loses her youth, she moves closer toward old age. She sees herself growing older in the mirror, as if an old woman is coming toward her. The old woman is herself when she is old: \u201cin me an old woman rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.\u201d",
