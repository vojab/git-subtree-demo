    "prompt": "The velocity of a moving object is its rate of motion in a specific direction. For example, a jogger heading north has velocity, because her direction is given. Vectors have both direction and magnitude, so velocity can be represented by a vector. In the case of the jogger, the magnitude of her velocity vector would be her rate of motion (like 12 mph), and the direction of the vector would be north.\r\n\r\nSpeed, on the other hand, has no direction, just magnitude. We would say a car\u2019s speed it 55 mph, because the car\u2019s direction isn\u2019t given. In which situation would speed be used to describe the rate of motion of the object?",

So, we would represent the snails rate of motion with speed, not velocity (that is, the speed of the snail is 0.5 ft\/min). In the other answer choices, the direction of the moving object is given, or implied.",
