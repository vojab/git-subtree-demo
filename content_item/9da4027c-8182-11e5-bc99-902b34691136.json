    "description": "Click the <u>one best answer<\/u> to each question.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\nThe largest lake in Mexico, Lake Chapala, is becoming smaller. Lakes naturally fluctuate in size because of seasonal rainfall and climate cycles, but Lake Chapala has been shrinking since the late 1970s. Less water comes into the lake because increased farming upstream removes water from rivers before it reaches the lake. Nearby Guadalajara, the second largest urban area in Mexico, has also been increasingly using water from Lake Chapala for the city\u2019s residents and industry. The lake is an important resource for the local tourism economy and as a home for many species of birds and fish.",
