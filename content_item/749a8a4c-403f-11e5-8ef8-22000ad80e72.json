    "description": "Within a particular species of an organism, individual characteristics can vary widely. Some of these variations arise from genetic differences and are passed down to subsequent generations. Other variations can be acquired over a lifetime and are not passed down through the generations. Still other variations are a combination of genetic inheritance and acquisition over a lifetime.",
