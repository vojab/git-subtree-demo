Please check back for detailed feedback on your response.<\/p>\r\n<p>An enduring social issue addressed in Albert Einstein\u2019s quote and George W. Bush\u2019s speech is <b>ethics, science, and government funding<\/b>. An excellent response will correctly cite evidence from the speech, the quote, and additional historical evidence to make an argument about science and ethics or related political issues. Relevant historical evidence might include experiments in Nazi concentration camps, the Tuskegee syphilis study, or human cloning.<\/p>\r\n<p>An excellent response will not summarize the passages, but instead use the provided information to take a stand on the enduring social issue. The response will support the position using multiple examples. The main idea will be clearly introduced at the beginning, and also restated at the end.<\/p>\r\n<p>Finally, an excellent response will be long enough to demonstrate the test taker can consistently use standard English writing conventions. It may not be perfect, but will have an acceptable number of errors for on-demand writing. The response will include a variety of precise words and a variety of sentence structures, including transition words that make the response easy to follow.<\/p>\r\n",
