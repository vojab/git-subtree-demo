    "feedback": "<p>When Democritus suggested the idea of atomos, he had no experimental data to base his ideas on. His ideas were rejected because Democritus could show no proof that matter was made of atomos. John Dalton\u2019s ideas were supported by experimental data, so he showed evidence of the existence of atoms. This evidence was confirmed by later experiments by other scientists.<\/p>\r\n<br\/>\r\nAround 400 B.C. in ancient Greece, Democritus suggested that matter was made up of tiny particles that he called atomos, but <b>Democritus never conducted any experiments<\/b> to prove whether this idea was true. <b>Without any evidence,<\/b> Aristotle and other philosophers of the time rejected the idea. For two thousand years, the idea of atoms was not widely accepted. Around 1803, though, John <b>Dalton used scientific data from chemical experiments<\/b> with gasses to propose a theory of atoms. Although some parts of Dalton\u2019s theory have since been proven incorrect, his concepts form the basis of our modern knowledge of atoms.",
