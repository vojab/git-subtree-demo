The word \u201ctoo\u201d means \u201calso,\u201d and the word \u201ctwo\u201d means the number 2. Both are inappropriate in this sentence. The correct word is \"to.\" The word \u201cand\u201d is also inappropriate; the sentence is talking about ending a debate. It should read \"vote to end the debate.\"",
