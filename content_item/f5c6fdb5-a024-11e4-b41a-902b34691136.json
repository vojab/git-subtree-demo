    "prompt": "<p>The first document presents an argument for prioritizing bilingualism in the United States. The second document presents an opposing viewpoint, that monolingualism (speaking only one language) is acceptable for U.S. citizens and bilingualism should not be prioritized over other learning.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In your response, analyze the positions present in both documents. Determine which of these two documents is best supported by evidence and reasoning. Use relevant and specific evidence from the documents to support your response.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may be that you share the opinion of the better argument; it may be that you share the opinion of the weaker argument. Remember that your task is to analyze and determine which argument is best supported and why, not which argument you agree with.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Type your response in the box. This should take approximately 45 minutes to complete.<\/p>",
