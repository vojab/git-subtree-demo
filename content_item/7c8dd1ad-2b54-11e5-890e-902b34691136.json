However, currently, they haven\u2019t reversed in twice that long. Based on these figures, it\u2019s likely that Earth\u2019s poles could reverse in the next few hundred thousand years. It\u2019s not likely that the poles will reverse suddenly, since the passage notes that reversals happen slowly.<\/p>\r\n",
