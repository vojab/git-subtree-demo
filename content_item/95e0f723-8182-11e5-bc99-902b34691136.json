    "title": "Question 20",
    "prompt": "A roller coaster rider wants to release her safety restraint after the big drop, since she believes it\u2019s far less dangerous to fall from the roller coaster once it\u2019s low to the ground. Is her belief accurate?",
    "description": "Click the <u>one best answer<\/u> to each question.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\n<b>Conservation of Energy:<\/b> As a roller coaster car gains height, it loses speed. Kinetic energy is converted into potential energy. The sum of potential energy and kinetic energy is constant. However, this model is somewhat simplified, since friction removes a certain amount of kinetic energy from the system.",

    "feedback": "After the large drop, the potential energy of the roller coaster (its distance from the ground) is converted to kinetic energy (its speed of forward motion). The potential energy is at its lowest point, and that means the kinetic energy is at its highest point. In other words, the car is moving fastest at the end of the drop. It\u2019s not much safer to fall from a fast-moving car than from a car high in the air.\r\n<br\/><img src='http:\/\/app.essentialed.com\/uploads\/assessments\/3378\/hju7qbvr3398.png' alt='Answer Explanation Image'>",
