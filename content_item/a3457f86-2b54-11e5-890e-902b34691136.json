Since World War II, the president has used the military for war-like activity several times. Most notably, Congress never declared war in Vietnam, however the U.S. military fought communist forces there from 1965-1973 - twice as long as World War II. Congress passed the War Powers Act that gave the president the ability to wage war without a declaration of war.",
