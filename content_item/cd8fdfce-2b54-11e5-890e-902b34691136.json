    "feedback": "After the collapse of the Roman Empire, Europe was plunged into the Dark Ages when many of the ideas of democracy were cast aside and feudalism took hold. Beginning in the 1300\u2019s in Italy, the ideas of individualism and self-worth began to be explored more deeply again. The Renaissance cultivated these ideas which ultimately led to the Enlightenment period, bringing forth the ideas of self governing. These ideas eventually brought the Industrial Revolution and an end to monarchies.",
