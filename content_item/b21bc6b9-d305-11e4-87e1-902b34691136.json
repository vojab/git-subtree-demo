    "feedback": "According to the passage, a bullion economy values the weight and purity of metals. Vikings cut up metal objects and carried scales to find the correct weight of metals for trade. In other words, Vikings went to a lot of trouble to trade using metal. By guaranteeing the weight and purity of their silver ingots, the Cappadocian rulers would have made trading using silver easier.",
