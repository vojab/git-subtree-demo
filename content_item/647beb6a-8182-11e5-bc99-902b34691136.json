There are three elements in this passage that show how the authorities viewed Sitting Bull. First, authorities disliked and distrusted the Ghost Dance religion, which Sitting Bull was interested in. Second, Sitting Bull had fought and defeated General Custer, so he had been an enemy in the past. Finally, the authorities decided to have Sitting Bull arrested. This shows that the authorities saw Sitting Bull as a potentially dangerous man who might lead the Native Americans against the government.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\n\u201cBecause the religion taught that European rule in America would end and Native Americans would retake their land, <strong>the government and white settlers were antagonistic toward the new religion.<\/strong>\u201d<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\u201cSitting Bull was a spiritual and political leader of the Hunkpapa Sioux who was well known for <strong>defeating General Custer at Little Bighorn.<\/strong>\u201d<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\u201cSitting Bull became interested in the Ghost Dance religion, and authorities, concerned that Sitting Bull would join the Ghost Dancers, <strong>arranged his arrest.<\/strong>\u201d",
