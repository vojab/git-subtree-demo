    "feedback": "This question requires an understanding of the idea of supply and demand. According to the economic law of supply and demand, a larger supply of a product (assuming the demand remains the same) will generate a reduction in price of that product. Since maize imports to Mexico tripled after NAFTA, there was a larger supply of maize in the Mexican marketplace. Based on supply and demand, a drop in price could be expected, and the price did drop by 50%. This is presumably a causal relationship.",
