    "prompt": "<p>After retiring from baseball in 1956, Jackie Robinson joined the civil rights movement, working for the NAACP and with Dr. Martin Luther King. Robinson corresponded with many people, including Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon. The letter to President Eisenhower was written four years after the landmark Supreme Court decision, Brown vs. the Board of Education.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In your response, develop an argument explaining how Robinson's 1958 letter to President Eisenhower reflects the continuing concern described in the quotation of George Washington. Incorporate relevant and specific evidence from both the letter and the quotation, as well as from your own knowledge of the civil rights movement, into your argument.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Type your response in the box. This task may require 25 minutes to complete.<\/p>",
