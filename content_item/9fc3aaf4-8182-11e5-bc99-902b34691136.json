    "description": "Click the <u>one best answer<\/u> to each question.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\nPlants absorb CO2 (carbon dioxide) from the air. Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere when animals and plants decay, when animals breathe, and when humans burn fossil fuels like coal, oil, and wood. Increased burning of fuel has caused an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and many scientists are investigating ways to reduce the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere through burning fuel. Some scientists are working on using algae, a plant-like organism, to clean the emissions from power plants.",
