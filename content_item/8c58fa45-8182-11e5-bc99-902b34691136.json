Kinetic energy is converted into potential energy. The sum of potential energy and kinetic energy is constant. However, this model is somewhat simplified, since friction removes a certain amount of kinetic energy from the system.",

    "feedback": "<p>Unless it is in a vacuum, a moving object will encounter friction. Friction occurs whenever matter moves against matter. In this example, there are two areas of friction. The roller coaster wheels against the track create friction, and the roller coaster moving against the air creates friction. Friction converts kinetic energy (speed) to heat energy, slowing down the moving object. This conversion of kinetic energy to heat energy is missing from the model. The text also notes that friction is a factor that this illustration doesn\u2019t take into account.<\/p>\r\n<br\/>\r\nAs a roller coaster car gains height, it loses speed.
