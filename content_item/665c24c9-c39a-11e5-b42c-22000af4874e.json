The first sentence introduces what the scientific method is. The second sentence describes how the scientific method starts. The third sentence builds on the second. The beginning of the sentence, \u201cwhen you have background information,\u201d shows that this sentence follows the second. The fourth sentence is about testing your hypothesis. Since the third sentence talks about constructing your hypothesis, this sentence logically follows. Finally, the fifth sentence talks about refining your hypothesis and planning more testing. It logically concludes the paragraph.\r\n<img src='http:\/\/app.essentialed.com\/uploads\/assessments\/4225\/gfs3vkry4275.png' alt='Answer Explanation Image'>",
