The other answer choices present facts about her life that are outside the focus on this paragraph, which is about Lovelace\u2019s contribution to the development of the computer. The fact that a programming language was named for her in recognition of her achievements does emphasize her importance, but it is outside the chronology of this paragraph and does not provide details about her contribution.  \r\n",
