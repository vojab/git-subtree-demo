    "description": "Click the <u>one best answer<\/u> to each question.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\nA pulley is a rope that runs around a wheel and changes the direction of force. A simple 1-pulley system, shown in the diagram, only changes the direction of the force. It doesn\u2019t reduce the force needed to lift a load. A 2-pulley system, as illustrated, changes the direction of the force and reduces it by half, but you must pull twice as much rope to lift the load. The more pulleys added to the system, the less force is needed and the more rope must be pulled.",

    "feedback": "A pulley system provides a trade-off between the amount of force needed to lift a load and the amount of rope (or time of application of force) needed to lift the weight. A two-pulley system reduces the amount of force needed to lift the weight, and increases the amount of time that force must be applied. To reduce the force to one tenth, or 50 pounds of force to lift a 500-pound weight, will require more pulleys and pulling more rope.",
