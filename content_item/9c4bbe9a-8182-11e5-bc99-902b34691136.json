When an electron loses energy, it emits a photon light) of a specific wavelength, depending on which level it jumps.",

The diagram also says, \u201cEach type of atom emits a unique pattern of light.\u201d Because the pattern of light for each kind of atom is unique, a line spectrograph will show an observer which type of atom is making the pattern. The line spectrograph is used to identify types of atoms by their electrons.",
