The word \u201cthem\u201d is talking about \u201cAmanda,\u201d but \u201cthem\u201d is plural, and Amanda is only one person. Changing the pronoun \u201cthem\u201d to \u201cher\u201d makes the sentence consistent and clear.<\/p>\r\n<br\/>\r\nIf I were in a position to hire <b>Amanda<\/b> again, I would certainly consider <b>her<\/b> for any appropriate position.",
