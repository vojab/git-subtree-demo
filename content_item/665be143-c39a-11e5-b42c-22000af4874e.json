It is measured by the amount of thermal energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram (1 g) of a substance by one degree Celsius (1\u00b0C). It takes more heat to increase the temperature of a substance with a high specific heat capacity than a substance with a low specific heat capacity. The graph below shows the temperature change of equal amounts of five different liquids heated with the same method for four minutes.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Using the drag-and-drop icons representing the different liquids, order the liquids from highest to lowest specific heat capacity. The liquid with the highest specific heat capacity will be on top. The liquid with the lowest specific heat capacity goes on the bottom.<\/b><\/p>\r\n",

Therefore, the liquid whose temperature increased the least has the highest specific heat capacity. Liquid A increased the least of all the liquids for the same amount of energy, so liquid A has the highest specific heat capacity. The other liquids fall in line alphabetically: B, C, D, and E. \r\n<img src='http:\/\/app.essentialed.com\/uploads\/assessments\/4091\/cq1iiow34244.png' alt='Answer Explanation Image'>",
