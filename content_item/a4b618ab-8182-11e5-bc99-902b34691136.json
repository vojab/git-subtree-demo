    "description": "Click the <u>one best answer<\/u> to each question.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\nPeople are often confused about whether tomatoes are fruits or vegetables. Because the tomato carries the tomato plant\u2019s seeds, their biological classification is a fruit. However, the tomato is used in cooking as a vegetable, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture classifies it as a vegetable. In 1893, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, for purposes of taxes, tomatoes are considered vegetables, since that is the popular definition of tomatoes.",
