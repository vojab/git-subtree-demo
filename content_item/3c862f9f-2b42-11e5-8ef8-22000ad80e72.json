    "feedback": "The correct answer is \"restore water flow and then.\" The sentence should read: \u201cWhen power is restored, the maintenance staff will restore water flow and then check pipes for leaks from possible freeze damage.\u201d Using a comma is incorrect because \u201cthen check pipes for leaks from possible freeze damage\u201d is a part of the compound predicate. It\u2019s not a sentence that can stand on its own. For the same reason, it\u2019s incorrect to make it a separate sentence! A semicolon before the word \u201cand\u201d is always incorrect. The correct answer is to use no punctuation and join the two parts of the predicate with the word \u201cand.\u201d",
