It explains what happened after Ann named the kitten and bought her a collar. As a consequence of warming up to Ann, Elsa enjoyed sitting on Ann\u2019s lap. The other answer choices don\u2019t make logical sense at this point in the story. Ann has already gotten a cat, so she\u2019s not still thinking about it. She\u2019s also already contacted a local shelter. Elsa was also dropped off at the shelter before this point in the story.",
