    "feedback": "The quote from Ecclesiastes talks about cycles. When it mentions the sun, it mentions the sun coming up, then going down, and finally returning to its starting point. The sun, like the wind and the rivers, moves through a cycle. Brett and Jake\u2019s relationship seems to have been troubled. When Brett says that they \u201ccould have had such a damned good time together,\u201d Jake doesn\u2019t seem to believe it. Like the setting of the sun each day, perhaps troubles are unavoidable. The rising and setting of the sun is like the ups and downs of Jake and Brett\u2019s relationship.",
