    "prompt": "<span style=\"font-weight:normal\"><p>The same side of the moon always faces earth. The far side of the moon contains far more craters than the near side. According to NASA scientist David Morrison:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The earth shields the near side of the moon from incoming asteroids, but that is not a large enough effect to influence crater densities. Just using simple straight-line geometry, you can calculate how much of the lunar sky is obscured by the earth, about 4 square degrees out of the 41,000 square degrees for the whole sky. This makes the earth negligible as a shield for the moon.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The real reason there are more impact craters on the far side of the moon is that the near side has a much thinner crust which has allowed volcanoes to erupt and fill in ancient large basins (or large impact craters). These large lava flows have covered craters that were formed early in the moon's history through the late heavy bombardment, which is when the largest percentage of impacts were occurring in the inner solar system. It is likely that each side of the moon has received equal numbers of impacts, but the resurfacing by lava results in fewer craters visible on the near side than the far side, even though both sides have received the same number of impacts.\"<\/p><\/span>\r\n\r\n<p><b>According to the passage, why are there more visible craters on the far side of the moon?<\/b><\/p>",
