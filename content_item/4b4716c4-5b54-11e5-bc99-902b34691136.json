The sentence is also describing something that is currently happening while they are in Korea, so it needs a present tense verb. The correct verb is \u201care expected.\u201d The verb \u201cis expected\u201d is singular. The verb \u201cwere expecting\u201d is past tense. The verb \u201care expecting\u201d indicates something that the students expect, not something the students are expected to do, so it is also incorrect.",
