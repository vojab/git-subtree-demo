Also, an object set in motion will continue to move in a straight path at a constant speed unless forces act upon it. For example, when a pitcher pitches a baseball, the ball would eventually slow down and be pulled towards the ground.<p> \r\n<p><b>Which of the following forces are acting on the ball as it travels through the air?<\/b><\/p>",
