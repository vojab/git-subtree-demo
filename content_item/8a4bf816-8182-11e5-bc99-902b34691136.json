    "prompt": "Saturn is the second largest planet in the solar system, and the closest it comes to Earth is approximately 1.2 billion kilometers. Saturn is surrounded by rings made of ice, dust, and rocks. Which of the following would be the best instrument to observe Saturn\u2019s rings from Earth?",

    "feedback": "Because Saturn is at least 1.2 billion miles away from Earth, it needs to be greatly magnified in order to view it from the Earth. Telescopes magnify objects so that they can be seen from distant locations. A telescope would be the best instrument to use to view Saturn\u2019s rings from Earth.",
