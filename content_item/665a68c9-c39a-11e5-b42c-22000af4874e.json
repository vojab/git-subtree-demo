    "description": "Evolution is the process by which organisms change over time.  Mutations produce genetic variation in populations, and the environment interacts with this variation to select those individuals best adapted to their surroundings.\r\n",

    "directions": null,

    "time_limit": null,
    "feedback": "The correct answer is \"Over time, the finches adapted to their specific environment.\"  Adaptation occurs when a trait that\u2019s beneficial to a species appears by mutation or already exists in variation in the species. Animals that have that trait are more likely to reproduce, so the trait is passed on to more members of the species. As long as the trait is a benefit in the specific environment, more and more individuals will have that trait. The finches adapted to their environment over time, acquiring traits that were beneficial.\r\n",
