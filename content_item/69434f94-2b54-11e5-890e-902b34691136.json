    "feedback": "The correct answer is 2. The methane molecule has four hydrogen atoms (H) and one carbon atom (C). The two oxygen molecules together have four oxygen atoms (O). The other side of the equation needs the same number of atoms. The carbon dioxide molecule has one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. That leaves four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms. There must be two water molecules to have four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms.\r\n",
