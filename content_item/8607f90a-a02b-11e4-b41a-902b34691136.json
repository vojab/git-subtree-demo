    "prompt": "Sally is a waiter at a family restaurant in a large city. She earns $150 per week in wages, plus tips. Her tips average 15% of her sales. In order to pay her bills she needs to make more than $600 per week. Use the numberline to show how much Sally needs to sell every week to make her budget. Click on the number line symbol you want to select and drag it to the correct place on the number line.",

    "feedback": "To find the complete the number line for this problem you first needed to set up and solve the equation for Sally. Convert the percent to a decimal: 15% = 0.15. Then let <em>s<\/em> be sales, and the following inequality describes the problem: <math>\r\n<mrow>\r\n <mn>600<\/mn>\r\n <mo><<\/mo>\r\n <mn>150<\/mn>\r\n <mo>+<\/mo>\r\n <mn>0.15<\/mn>\r\n <mo>\u22c5<\/mo>\r\n <mi>s<\/mi>\r\n<\/mrow>\r\n<\/math>. Next you needed to solve for sales: <math><mi>s<\/mi><mo> ><\/mo><mn> $3,000<\/mn><\/math>. Then you can place the open circle with the arrow pointing right over the 3000 on the number line showing any sales greater than $3,000 would keep Sally within her budget.<img src='\/uploads\/content-assets\/math-assessment-1\/164-Explanation.png' alt='Answer Explanation Image'>",
