    "feedback": "To answer this question, you must determine what causes voting rights to be more or less democratic. The table notes that in a democracy, decisions are made by people through voting. Sparta also had voting, but only for a few elite citizens. Since it is not considered a democracy, the more people can vote, the more democratic voting is. Since Athens had slaves who could not vote and did not allow women to vote, the United States allows a greater proportion of its population to vote. Voting rights in the United States are more democratic than in Athens.",
