Instead, they hunt their prey, moving over stones or through grasses and plants. Researchers studying the Pardosa milvina wolf spider divided caged spiders into two groups, one that received constant food (high fed) and the other that received no food during the test (low fed). They gathered the following data about the spiders\u2019 movement.",
