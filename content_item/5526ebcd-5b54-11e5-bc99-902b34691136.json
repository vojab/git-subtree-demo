The dependent, or subordinate, clause \u201cbecause the server spilled spaghetti sauce all over her dress\u201d is at the end of the sentence, so no comma is needed.<\/p>\r\n<p>The choice \u201cThe server at the restaurant spilled spaghetti sauce all over the woman's dress, she complained to the manager\u201d is a comma splice. Two sentences cannot be joined by only a comma.<\/p>\r\n<p>The choice \u201cThe server at the restaurant spilled spaghetti sauce all over the woman's dress because, she complained, to the manager\u201d is incorrect. It doesn\u2019t express the most appropriate cause-and-effect relationship, since it makes more sense that the woman complained because the server spilled spaghetti sauce. It also has unneeded commas after \u201cbecause\u201d and \u201ccomplained.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>The choice \u201cThe woman complained to the manager during the server at the restaurant spilling spaghetti sauce all over her dress\u201d doesn\u2019t make the correct logical relationship between the sentences. These sentences describe cause and effect. The word \u201cduring\u201d shows a relationship where two things are happening at the same time.<\/p>",
