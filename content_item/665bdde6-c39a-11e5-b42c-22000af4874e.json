To prove that the pond is polluted by nearby fertilizer, she would need to compare her data against another nearby pond that isn\u2019t near similar fertilizer but is similar in other ways. This would give Gloria a ____________ to compare her experimental data against.",

To prove that the pond is polluted, Gloria will need to show that other nearby ponds are NOT eutrophic. This will show that eutrophic ponds are not a feature of the local ecosystem, and that something is causing this pond, in particular, to have a problem. This would support the idea that the pond is polluted. \r\n",
