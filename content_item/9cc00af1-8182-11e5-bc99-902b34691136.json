    "prompt": "In science lab, a pair of students each carefully measured an earthworm of the species Lumbricus terrestris twelve times in order to get the most accurate measurement for their data. The first student\u2019s measurements ranged from 11.2250 centimeters to 11.2500 centimeters. The second student\u2019s measurements ranged from 11.2125 centimeters to 11.2375 centimeters. Which of the following is the best method to report the length of the earthworm? ",

    "feedback": "All of the measurements are slightly different, so the differences can be accounted for by errors in measurement because of imprecise equipment or working conditions. For example, how straight is the worm laid out? The students took a large number of measurements, and the small errors probably give both longer and shorter measurements than the actual length of the worm. An average of all the numbers is the best method of reporting the worm\u2019s length.",
