In other words, they could stand alone as complete sentences. They should not be joined by just a comma. You could add the word \u201cand\u201d after the comma to join the two independent clauses, but since both clauses have the same subject (\u201cthey\u201d refers to \u201cthird degree burns\u201d), you can remove the word \u201cthey\u201d and join the two verb phrases with the word \u201cand.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<br\/>\r\nThird degree burns <b>destroy all layers of the skin and harm underlying tissue<\/b>.",
