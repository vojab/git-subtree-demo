Because it\u2019s not necessary to the main idea of the sentence, it should be set off by a comma. Placing this modifier near \u201cpark\u201d makes the most sense and keeps the main idea of the sentence together. There is no need to put a comma before \u201cthrough the park,\u201d which is part of the main idea of the sentence.",
