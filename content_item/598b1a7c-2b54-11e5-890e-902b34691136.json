    "feedback": "Since heat will flow from warm substances to cooler substances, the heat from the coffee will transfer to the spoon and creamer. Having lost some of its heat, the coffee will get cooler. Eventually the creamer and spoon will be heated to the same temperature as the coffee, leaving nowhere cooler for the heat to travel except the air around the cup of coffee. This means that all three elements will eventually become the same temperature. This is called thermal equilibrium.",
