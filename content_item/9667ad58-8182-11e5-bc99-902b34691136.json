Kinetic energy is converted into potential energy. The sum of potential energy and kinetic energy is constant. However, this model is somewhat simplified, since friction removes a certain amount of kinetic energy from the system.",

In 1837, Karl Friedrich Mohr wrote one of the earliest general statements describing conservation of energy. This idea has been refined and tested over more than 150 years.\r\n<br\/><img src='http:\/\/app.essentialed.com\/uploads\/assessments\/3378\/ss1rycvm3399.png' alt='Answer Explanation Image'>",
