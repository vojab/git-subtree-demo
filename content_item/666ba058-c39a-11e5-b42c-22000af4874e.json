And the center of the screen is where you read the book. That\u2019s probably not a good place to look for controls, either. At the bottom of the screen, there\u2019s a progress bar with forward and back buttons and page numbers--that\u2019s probably a way to get around the book, but it doesn\u2019t seem like there are more controls there. The tab on the left is a good place to start. The tab shows that there\u2019s something there, so it\u2019s a good place to look for controls.\r\n",
