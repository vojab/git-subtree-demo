    "feedback": "The correct answer is \"cause.\" The sentence should read: \u201cThe chemical reactions in the battery cause electrons to build up at the anode, or negative terminal.\u201d The subject of this sentence is the plural word \u201creactions.\u201d It needs a plural verb: \u201ccause.\u201d  Because there is a phrase ending in a singular word (\u201cin the battery\u201d) between the subject and verb, it might be difficult to tell which verb is correct. If you remove the phrase, it\u2019s easier to tell which answer is correct. \u201cThe chemical reactions cause electrons to build up\u201d sounds correct. \u201cThe chemical reactions causes electrons to build up\u201d sounds wrong.",
