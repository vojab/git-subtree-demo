The choice \u201cwere excited\u201d is incorrect because it indicates that the excitement only took place in the past. The singular verb \u201cis excited\u201d does not match the plural subject \u201cstudents.\u201d The first-person verb \u201cam excited\u201d only matches a first-person subject such as \u201cI.\u201d",
