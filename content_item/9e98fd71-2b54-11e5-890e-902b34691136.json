The number of people employed dropped by about 8,000,000 from 2008 to 2010. The space between the lines for civilian workforce and civilian employment widened from 2008 to 2010, indicating a rise in unemployment. Since 2010 the number of people employed has increased. The difference between the two lines in the graph remained the same from 2005 to 2010, indicating that the unemployment rate did not change.",
