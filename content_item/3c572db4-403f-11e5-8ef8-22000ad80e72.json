Wind, however, is just moving air created by the heat from the sun and therefore is a renewable resource. A renewable resource becomes non-renewable when it is consumed faster than nature can replace it.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Which of the following is also an example of a nonrenewable resource?<\/b><\/p>",
