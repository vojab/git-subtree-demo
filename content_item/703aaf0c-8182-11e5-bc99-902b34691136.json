    "feedback": "The Supreme Court ruling requires suspects to be warned of their rights because it assumes that police interrogations pressure suspects to confess. If the police did not pressure suspects to confess, suspects would not need to be warned that they had the right to remain silent to protect them against self-incrimination.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\nThe majority of the Court based its decision on the Fifth Amendment\u2019s <strong>protection against self-incrimination<\/strong> and the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of an attorney. The Court decided that suspects must be informed of their constitutional rights to <strong>counteract pressure and persuasion.<\/strong> In the 5\u20134 majority decision, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote, \u201cThe warning of the right to remain silent must be accompanied by the explanation that anything said can and will be used against the individual in court. This warning is needed in order to make him aware not only of the privilege, but also of the consequences of forgoing it.\u2026 [T]his warning may serve to make the individual more acutely aware that he is faced with a phase of the adversary system\u2014that <strong>he is not in the presence of persons acting solely in his interests.<\/strong>\u2026\u201d",
