They determined that the whole city was burned, but they only looked at some kinds of areas, the wealthy areas. The controversy arose when poorer areas of the city were excavated and found unburned. That \u201conly the palaces and temples, areas used by the elite upper class\u201d were excavated shows that only some types of areas were excavated. The conclusion that the \u201cwhole city was ravaged and burned\u201d shows that the conclusion was about the whole city.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\nWhen archaeologists first studied the city of Teotihuac\u00e1n, located near modern-day Mexico City, they excavated <strong>only the palaces and temples, areas used by the elite upper class.<\/strong> All these sites showed damage from fire around the 7th or 8th century. Early archaeologists concluded that the <strong>whole city was ravaged and burned<\/strong> by invaders, possibly the Toltecs.",
