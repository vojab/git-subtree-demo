Holmes looked keenly at him.<br \/>\r\n\u201cAnything remarkable on hand?\u201d he asked.<br \/>\r\n\u201cOh, no, Mr. Holmes\u2014nothing very particular.\u201d<br \/>\r\n\u201cThen tell me about it.\u201d <br \/>\r\nLestrade laughed.<br \/>\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Holmes, there is no use denying that there is something on my mind. And yet it is such an absurd business, that I hesitated to bother you about it. On the other hand, although it is trivial, it is undoubtedly queer, and I know that you have a taste for all that is out of the common\u2026\u201d",
