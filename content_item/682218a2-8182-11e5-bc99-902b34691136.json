The 2004 bar represents only official registered unemployment in urban areas. A graph should not compare overall unemployment to only urban unemployment.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\nAccording to the CIA\u2019s website, an official Chinese journal estimated <strong>overall unemployment (including rural areas)<\/strong> for 2003 at 20%.
