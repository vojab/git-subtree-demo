The sentence could be corrected by adding a comma, but this sentence also has some redundant elements. The phrase and \u201cafter that\u201d is redundant with \u201cthen.\u201d Also, the two independent clauses have the same subject, although the second one uses a pronoun. Both clauses also use the same modal, or helping verb, <u>will<\/u>. The pronoun and modal can be removed from the second independent clause. This eliminates the need for a comma.\r\n<br\/>\r\nMr. Lombe will also review ideas under development and then open the floor for additional ideas and comments.",
