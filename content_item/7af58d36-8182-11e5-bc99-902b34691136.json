When Joseph Welch spoke of McCarthy\u2019s cruelty and recklessness, he was making a judgment about the quality of McCarthy\u2019s ethics and actions. Although Welch\u2019s opinion may be well founded, it is an opinion, not a fact.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\nThe army hired Boston lawyer Joseph Welch to make its case. At a session on June 9, 1954, McCarthy charged that one of Welch\u2019s attorneys had ties to a Communist organization. As an amazed television audience looked on, Welch responded with the immortal lines that ultimately ended McCarthy\u2019s career: \u201cUntil this moment, Senator, I think I never really gauged <strong>your cruelty or your recklessness<\/strong>.\u201d When McCarthy tried to continue his attack, Welch angrily interrupted, \u201cLet us not assassinate this lad further, senator. You have done enough. Have you no sense of decency?\u201d",
