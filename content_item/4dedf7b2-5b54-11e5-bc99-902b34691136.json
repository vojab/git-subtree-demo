The correct verb is \u201cwere able.\u201d It matches the plural subject and is in the correct tense, past tense. The verb \u201cwas able\u201d is incorrect because it is singular. The verb \u201cwere abled\u201d isn\u2019t correct. \u201cAbled\u201d isn\u2019t a correct form of the word \u201cable.\u201d The verb \u201chad able\u201d is also incorrect. It is similar to the form \u201chad been able,\u201d but it is not a correct verb form.",
