    "prompt": "A scientist has a two-pronged thermometer that can be connected to two liquids. In an experiment, the scientist connects the thermometer to a liquid that is known to be 52\u00b0. After waiting for the liquids to stabilize, the thermometer reads 68\u00b0. What is true about the original temperature of the second liquid?",
    "description": "The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two substances of different temperatures are brought together, heat will transfer from the warmer substance to the cooler substance. If two substances are each in equilibrium with a third substance, as shown in the diagram, they are in equilibrium with each other.",

    "feedback": "The temperature of the second liquid was originally above 68\u00b0. Since both liquids are connected to the thermometer, when the system equalizes, both liquids will be the same temperature. That equalized temperature is higher than the temperature of the 52\u00b0 liquid, so the temperature of the second liquid was higher than the equalized temperature. The temperature of one liquid goes up as they equalize, and the temperature of the other goes down.",
