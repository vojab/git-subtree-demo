    "description": "A flu pandemic is an outbreak of a contagious flu virus that spreads world wide in a relatively short period of time. Though pandemics are often deadly, the number of deaths does not determine whether a virus is a pandemic, but rather how the disease spreads. In 2009 an outbreak of influenza virus H1N1, commonly referred to as \"swine flu\", occurred. Symptoms of the disease included fevers of 100\u00b0F or higher, nasal secretions, barking cough, headaches, and fatigue. The disease was transmitted from one person to another through droplets from coughs or sneezes of the infected person being breathed in or ingested by an uninfected person. This virus was first identified in pigs in 1930, which is how it got its name. It is not common for viruses to spread from one species to another, such as from pigs to humans, or vice versa. The H1N1 virus had crossed over and infected humans in the past, but infections did not spread outside of the local area where the pigs and humans lived.",
