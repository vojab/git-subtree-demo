It\u2019s a description, not a name. There should also be a comma introducing the direct quote.<\/p>\r\n<p>This choice is also incorrect: \"The fire burned down a few homes\" She said to the police officer.<\/p>\r\n<p>In this case, the sentence begins with a direct quote. There should be a comma before the closing quote, and the word \u201cshe\u201d should not be capitalized, since it is not at the beginning of the sentence.<\/p>\r\n<p>The other incorrect choice is: She said, \"the fires burned down a few homes,\" to the police officer.<\/p>\r\n<p>This is a poorly worded choice. It\u2019s best to keep the prepositional phrase \u201cto the police officer\u201d with \u201csaid.\u201d Also, the first word of the direct quote should be capitalized.<\/p>",
