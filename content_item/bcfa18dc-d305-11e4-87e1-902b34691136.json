The most immediate danger people would face after a nuclear explosion is the nuclear fallout carried by the wind. To protect people from that fallout, shelters were build underground and as far away as possible from the contaminated air. The incorrect answers might be considerations, but they are not the main reason fallout shelters were built underground.",
