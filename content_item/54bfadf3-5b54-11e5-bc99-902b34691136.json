    "feedback": "<p>The best response uses the word \u201cbecause\u201d to show the relationship between the two sentences: \u201cBecause the house was over 70 years old, it needed some repairs.\u201d The dependent or subordinate clause is stated first (because the house was over 70 years old).  The main clause (it needed some repairs) is stated second, and a comma is needed to separate the subordinate clause from the main clause.<\/p>\r\n<p>The sentence \u201cThe house needed some repairs resulting, in it being over 70 years old\u201d doesn\u2019t make the correct relationship between the sentences. The repairs did not cause the house to be old. Also, the comma after \u201cresulting\u201d should be after \u201crepairs\u201d instead.<\/p>\r\n<p>The sentence \u201cThe repairs in the house were needed, finally it was over 70 years old\u201d is a run-on. Two sentences can\u2019t be joined with a comma and the word \u201cfinally.\u201d Also, the word \u201cfinally\u201d doesn\u2019t make the correct logical connection between the two sentences.<\/p>\r\n<p>The sentence \u201cHowever, the house was over 70 years old some new repairs were needed\u201d is also a run-on. The two sentences cannot be joined without any punctuation or conjunctions. Also, the word \u201chowever\u201d doesn\u2019t make the correct logical connection between the two sentences.<\/p>",
