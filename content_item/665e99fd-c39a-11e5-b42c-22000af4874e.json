Because Internet comments are often anonymous, people can post comments that are only meant to cause angry reactions without consequences. Eliminating the ability to post anonymously on a website might be a solution to reduce trolling, because people can see who is making the offensive comment. It might also have other consequences, though, like making people more reluctant to talk about controversial or difficult issues.\r\n",
