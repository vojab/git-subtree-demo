So is: \u201cTemperatures are not expected to drop below 50 degrees.\u201d Two independent clauses cannot be joined by a comma or without any punctuation. The conjunction \u201cor\u201d is not appropriate to describe the relationship between these clauses. The best answer is to make two separate sentences, using a period.",
