    "prompt": "On earth, the poles and regions near the equator experience mild seasonal changes, while some regions in-between can experience more dramatic seasonal climate changes. For example, a typical winter in North Dakota can have temperatures well below 0 \u00b0F, yet summer temperatures can exceed 80 \u00b0F. <br><br><b>What is the cause of these seasonal changes on earth?<\/b>",

    "feedback": "Planets orbit the sun in a slightly elliptical path. While it is true that the earth would then be closer to the sun during certain parts of its orbit, it isn't the primary cause of temperature differences between equatorial regions and the poles. The tilt of the earth exposes equatorial regions to direct sunlight more that the poles, which contributes greatly to seasonal changes on earth.",
