    "feedback": "When Torvald reminds Nora of how long it will be before they get the money from his new salary, she immediately says that they can just borrow money until then. She sees borrowing as a convenience during the next few months: \u201cPooh! we can borrow until then.\u201d Meanwhile, Torvald sees borrowing as a risk, no matter how certain future money is. He hypothesizes that he could die and not be able to pay the money back: \u201cSuppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds today \u2026 and then on New Year\u2019s Eve a slate fell on my head and killed me\u2026\u201d Torvald also sees borrowing as shameful, calling a life without debt the \u201cstraight road.\u201d He doesn\u2019t think that a good life can be built on borrowing: \u201cThere can be no freedom or beauty about a home life that depends on borrowing and debt. We two have kept bravely on the straight road so far\u2026\u201d",
