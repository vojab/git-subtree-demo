    "feedback": "The question asks for an argument that opposes Maggie\u2019s stance. Her argument is that no Japanese surprise attacks followed Pearl Harbor, and therefore the internment worked. The flaw in the argument is that there may be other reasons why the Japanese did not attack the U.S. again. The correct answer states that no interned Japanese Americans were convicted of espionage. The implication of this information is that the American government had no proof that Japanese spies were among those interned. If the internees were not spies, the internment was unlikely to prevent another attack. This answer logically argues against Maggie\u2019s statement.\r\n<br\/>\r\n<br\/>\r\n<strong>Argument:<\/strong> After all, there wasn\u2019t another Japanese surprise attack, was there? It must have worked.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Counter Argument:<\/strong> No Japanese Americans who were arrested or held were later convicted of espionage. If no internees were spies, the internment could not have prevented an attack.",
