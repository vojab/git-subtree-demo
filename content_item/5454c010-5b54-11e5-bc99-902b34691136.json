Since the dependent clause \u201cbecause it needed a new engine\u201d is at the end of the sentence, no comma is needed before the clause.<\/p>\r\n<p>The sentence \u201cThe car was making an unusual noise the new engine was the reason\u201d is a run-on.

A word like \u201cconsequently,\u201d \u201ctherefore,\u201d or \u201chowever\u201d can be used as a transition, but the sentences need to be joined with a semicolon. The transition word should have a comma after it, like this: \u201cThe car was making an unusual noise; consequently, it needed a new engine.\u201d<\/p>",
