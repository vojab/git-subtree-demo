The Miranda warning refers to the right to remain silent and the right to legal representation that are protected by the Fifth Amendment. It is called the \u201cMiranda\u201d warning after the US Supreme Court ruling Miranda v Arizona in 1966. Ernesto Miranda was arrested, interrogated, and convicted based on his confession without consulting a lawyer. The Supreme Court ruled this was in violation of his constitutional rights. Therefore, before any arrest or interrogation, police must read the \u201cMiranda warning\u201d to suspects. \r\n",
