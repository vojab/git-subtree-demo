    "feedback": "We know that if you have a bad temper, you get angry easily. So \"temper\" has something to do with your state of mind. Roosevelt thanks Americans for their \"good temper,\" so \"good temper\" is something Roosevelt likes and appreciates. Because the country is in a state of crisis and Roosevelt is urging people not to panic, \"good temper\" must mean a calm state of mind. The incorrect answers do not address both the root word \"temper\" and the context in which the phrase is used.",
