Subordinating conjunctions are words like though, although, which,if, because, when, where, unless, until, and since. A clause that begins with a subordinating conjunction cannot stand on its own, even if it has a subject and verb in it. The simplest way to make this into a complete sentence is to delete the word \u201cthough.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<br\/>\r\nAmanda has been a valuable asset during her time with us.",
